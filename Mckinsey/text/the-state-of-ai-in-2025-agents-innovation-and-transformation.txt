The state of  
AI in 2025  
November 2025
Agents, innovation, and transformation 
Almost all survey respondents  
say their organizations are using  
AI, and many have begun to use  
AI agents. But most are still in  
the early stages of scaling AI and 
capturing enterprise-level value. 
This article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with 
Bryce Hall and Tara Balakrishnan, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.
Key findings  
1.   Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase: Nearly two-thirds 
of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise. 
2.   High curiosity in AI agents: Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their 
organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents. 
3.   Positive leading indicators on impact of AI: Respondents report use-case level cost and 
revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 
39 percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.  
4.   High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost: Eighty percent of 
respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives,  
but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as 
additional objectives. 
5.   Redesigning workflows is a key success factor: Half of those AI high performers intend 
to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows. 
6.   Differing perspectives on employment impact: Respondents vary in their expectations 
of AI’s impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 
32 percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13 percent increases.

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  
Three years since  the introduction of gen AI tools 
triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine 
out of ten survey respondents say their organizations 
are regularly using AI—but the pace of progress 
remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, 
most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough 
into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-
level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI 
reveals a landscape defined by both wider use—including growing 
proliferation of agentic AI—and stubborn growing pains, with the 
transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress 
at most organizations.

AI use continues to broaden but 
remains primarily in pilot phases  
Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, 
though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their 
organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research 
last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 
78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or 
piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have 
begun to scale their AI programs.

capability in business processes or products. From 2020, the de/f_inition was that the organization has adopted AI in at least 1 function, and in 2025, the de/f_ini-

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  
Many organizations are already experimenting with AI agents  
Organizations are also beginning to explore opportunities with AI agents—systems based on 
foundation models capable of acting in the real world, planning and executing multiple steps in a 
workflow. Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic 
AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of 
the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have 
begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those 
who are scaling agents say they’re only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business 
function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents 
(Exhibit 2).

Looking at individual business functions, agent use is most commonly reported in IT and 
knowledge management, where agentic use cases such as service-desk management in IT and 
deep research in knowledge management have quickly developed. By industry, the use of AI 
agents is most widely reported in the technology, media and telecommunications, and healthcare 
sectors (Exhibit 3).

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  
McKinsey commentary
Michael Chui
Senior fellow
AI agents have been the subject of intense buzz and excitement. Already, about a quarter of 
our survey respondents report that they have started scaling at least one agentic AI system, 
but usually only in one or two business functions. Looking across the entire enterprise 
landscape, the use of agents is not yet widespread. This gap highlights the contrast between 
the great potential that manifests in a “hype cycle” and the current reality on the ground: For 
those companies that respondents say have started to use agents in any particular business 
function, most of them are still in the exploratory stages. And as we recently documented in 
another article  about the lessons we’ve learned from a year of building agentic AI tools: When 
it comes to agents, it takes hard work to do it well.
7 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  Twenty-three percent of respondents 
report their organizations are scaling  
an agentic AI system somewhere 
in their enterprises.
 For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases
The use of AI overall is broadening within organizations. Respondents increasingly report that 
their organizations are using AI in more business functions (Exhibit 4). More than two-thirds of 
respondents now say their organizations are using AI in more than one function, and half report 
using AI in three or more functions (for a breakdown by industry, see sidebar, “Reported AI use 
ticks upward in nearly every industry”).

tion asks about 11 functions: HR; IT; manufacturing: marketing and sales; product and/or service development; risk, legal, and compliance; service operations; 
software engineering; strategy and corporate /f_inance; supply chain/inventory management; and knowledge management.

Reported AI use ticks upward 
in nearly every industry
In every industry  besides the technology 
sector (which had already exceeded 90 
percent reporting AI use), the share of 
respondents saying that their organization 
is regularly using AI in at least one business 
function has meaningfully increased since 
our previous survey. In last year’s research, 
respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of 
other industries with respect to their use 
of AI. Now, respondents in media and 
telecommunications and insurance are just 
as likely as those in technology to report 
AI use (exhibit). Throughout eight years of 
AI research, we have consistently seen IT 
and marketing and sales as the business 
functions that respondents most often say 
are using AI. But our latest findings show 
that knowledge management is now also 
one of the functions with the most reported 
AI use. Looking at individual use cases within 
business functions, respondents most 
often report using AI to capture information 
as well as processing and delivering it, such 
as through a conversational interface; in 
content support for marketing strategy, 
including drafting, generating ideas, 
and presenting knowledge for creating 
marketing strategies; and in contact-center 
or customer service automation.

However, many companies—particularly smaller ones—have yet to integrate AI deeply across 
their workflows. While only one-third of all respondents say they are scaling their AI programs 
across their organizations, larger companies—both in terms of revenues and the number of 
employees—are more likely to have reached the scaling phase. Nearly half of respondents from 
companies with more than $5 billion in revenue have reached the scaling phase, compared with 
29 percent of those with less than $100 million in revenues (Exhibit 5).

AI as a catalyst for innovation
Responses suggest that for most organizations, the use of AI has not yet significantly affected 
enterprise-wide EBIT. Thirty-nine percent of respondents attribute any level of EBIT impact to 
AI, and most of those respondents say that less than 5 percent of their organization’s EBIT is 
attributable to AI use. However, respondents see other company-wide qualitative outcomes: A 
majority say that their organizations’ use of AI has improved innovation, and nearly half report 
improvement in customer satisfaction and competitive differentiation (Exhibit 6).

McKinsey commentary
Alex Singla
Senior partner 
Last year, we noted that generative AI was no longer a novelty and that enterprise adoption 
was spreading as companies rewired to help realize value. This year’s data confirm that 
trajectory—AI use is broadening, but scale still lags. We are seeing that while companies 
may have rolled out AI tools, most have not yet productized use cases, redesigned workflows 
around AI and agentic capabilities, or built the platforms/guardrails needed to run them at 
scale. In working with organizations, we find that the largest ones have the scale to invest in 
AI to advance more quickly. The companies reporting EBIT impact tend to have progressed 
further in their scaling journeys. All business leaders are seeking to make their companies 
more efficient, but the real results emerge when leaders are also able to use technology 
to innovate.
Revenue increases resulting from AI use are most commonly reported in use cases within 
marketing and sales, strategy and corporate finance, and product and service development, 
which is consistent with what we’ve seen over the years we have been conducting the survey 
(Exhibit 8).

Organizations with ambitious 
AI agendas are seeing 
the most benefit 
Meaningful enterprise-wide bottom-line impact from the use of AI continues to be rare, though 
our survey results suggest that thinking big can pay off. Respondents who attribute EBIT impact 
of 5 percent or more to AI use and say their organization has seen “significant” value from AI 
use—our definition of AI high performers, representing about 6 percent of respondents—report 
pushing for transformative innovation via AI, redesigning workflows, scaling faster, implementing 
best practices for transformation, and investing more.
High performers have bold ambitions to transform their business: AI high performers are more 
than three times more likely than others are to say their organization intends to use AI to bring 
about transformative change to their businesses (Exhibit 9).

Organizations seeing the greatest impact from AI often aim to achieve more than cost 
reductions from these technologies. While most respondents report that efficiency gains are 
an objective of their organizations’ AI use, high performers are more likely than others are to 
say their organizations have also set growth and/or innovation as an objective of their AI efforts 
(Exhibit 10).

What stands out most about the  high performers is their level of ambition. Their AI agendas go 
beyond driving incremental efficiency gains: High performers are setting out to fundamentally 
reimagine their businesses. This level of ambition becomes a key differentiator and catalyst 
for change in the organization. When leaders articulate a transformative vision for AI, we 
see that it galvanizes the organization in terms of alignment, investment, and overall energy. 
As a result, leading organizations are not just seeing improved automation results; they are 
redesigning workflows and customer experiences to capture new forms of value.
Often, organizations approach AI through a cost-first mindset. While many see leading 
indicators from efficiency gains, focusing only on cost can limit AI’s impact. Positioning AI 
as an enabler of growth and innovation creates space within the organization to go after 
the cost and efficiency improvements more effectively. And for many organizations, an 
efficiency play will not be sufficient to navigate AI disruption. They will need to consider 
how AI can be leveraged to tell a transformational story to their stakeholders. Doing so also 
supports change management internally. Employees tend to rally behind a shared vision 
of opportunity. In our experience, many of the organizations that use AI to inspire growth 
and innovation are the same ones that find it easier to scale AI use and ultimately realize 
sustainable productivity improvements. 
In addition to high aspirations at the enterprise level, high performers are also nearly three 
times as likely as others are to say their organizations have fundamentally redesigned individual 
workflows (Exhibit 11). Indeed, this intentional redesigning of workflows has one of the strongest 
contributions to achieving meaningful business impact of all the factors tested.1 
1  To identify which organizational practices differentiate high performers, we conducted a relative weights analysis on 31 
variables. This method estimates each variable’s unique contribution to explaining high-performance status, accounting for 
correlations among predictors.Exhibit 11

AI high performers are also regularly using AI in more business functions than their peers. These 
respondents are much more likely than others are to report use in marketing and sales, strategy 
and corporate finance, and product and service development, for example. Additionally, high 
performers have advanced further with their use of AI agents than others have. In most business 
functions, AI high performers are at least three times more likely than their peers to report that 
they are scaling their use of agents (Exhibit 12).

The findings also show that AI high performers’ use of AI is more often championed by their 
leaders. High performers are three times more likely than their peers to strongly agree that 
senior leaders at their organizations demonstrate ownership of and commitment to their AI 
initiatives (Exhibit 13).  These respondents are also much more likely than others are to say that 
senior leaders are actively engaged in driving AI adoption, including role modeling the use of AI.

In addition to having senior leadership ownership and commitment, AI high performers are 
also more likely to employ a range of practices to realize value from AI use. For example, high 
performers are more likely than others are to say their organizations have defined processes to 
determine how and when model outputs need human validation to ensure accuracy (Exhibit 14). 
This is another one of the top factors we tested to determine those that most distinguished high 
performers. The full set of management practices align with our broader Rewired  research, which 
is based on more than 200 at-scale AI transformations. They span six dimensions essential to 
capturing value from AI: strategy, talent, operating model, technology, data, and adoption and 
scaling. All of the management practices we tested correlate positively with value attributable to 
AI. These practices enable organizations to innovate and capture value from AI at scale.

Having an agile product delivery organization, or an enterprise-wide agile organization with well-
defined delivery processes, is also strongly correlated with achieving value. Establishing robust 
talent strategies and implementing technology and data infrastructure similarly show meaningful 
contributions to AI success, and practices such as embedding AI into business processes and 
tracking KPIs for AI solutions further contribute to achieving significant value. 
Finally, high-performing organizations are investing more in AI capabilities. More than one-third 
of high performers say their organizations are committing more than 20 percent of their digital 
budgets to AI technologies (Exhibit 15). These resources are helping them scale AI technologies 
across the business: About three-quarters of high performers say their organizations are scaling

McKinsey commentary
Bryce Hall
Associate partner
Particularly in the context of massive investments in AI and lofty valuations of many AI 
companies, it makes sense that executives are taking a hard look at where  AI is actually 
creating value, and how AI leaders are successfully capturing value from their investments. 
This year’s survey suggests that leading organizations successfully implement a set of 
practices that bridge the interface between AI and human users. In fact, one of the leading 
practices is effectively determining how and when to incorporate “human in the loop,” for 
example, in the development, testing, and deployment of AI solutions. This is consistent 
with our real-world experience with companies, too; AI is rarely a stand-alone solution. 
Instead, companies capture value when they effectively enable employees with real-world 
domain experience to interact with AI solutions at the right points. The combination of AI 
solutions alongside human judgment and expertise is what creates real “hybrid intelligence” 
superpowers and real value capture. AI leaders adopt a set of other practices that point in this 
same direction, including fully embedding AI solutions into business workflows and having 
senior leaders actively engaged in driving adoption at scale.
Interestingly, the ten leading management practices highlighted by this year’s survey 
include all six elements of McKinsey’s Rewired  playbook  for digital and AI transformations. 
While each year we test new practices, one evergreen principle holds true: Companies that 
effectively deliver across six primary elements (strategy, talent, operating model, technology, 
data, and adoption and scaling) are the ones reporting significant value creation from their 
AI investments.
Expectations vary on AI’s effect  
on workforce size
As organizations expand their use of AI, respondents share differing perspectives on how 
AI might affect their workforce size in the year ahead. Looking at the functions in which 
organizations are using AI, a plurality of respondents observed little to no change in the number 
of employees due to their organization’s use of AI in the past year. In most functions, fewer than 
20 percent of respondents report decreases of 3 percent or more, and smaller shares say their 
organization’s AI use led them to add head count within functions.   
However, larger shares of respondents expect changes in the number of employees in these 
functions in the year ahead (Exhibit 16). Across business functions, a median of 17 percent of 
respondents report declines in functions’ workforce size in the past year as a result of AI use, but 
a median of 30 percent expect a decrease in the next year.

Expectations differ on the impact of AI on the size of respondents’ enterprise-wide total 
workforce. While a plurality of respondents expect to see little or no effect on their organizations’ 
total number of employees in the year ahead, 32 percent predict an overall reduction of 3 percent 
or more, and 13 percent predict an increase of that magnitude (Exhibit 17). Respondents at larger 
organizations are more likely than those at smaller ones to expect an enterprise-wide AI-related 
reduction in workforce size, while AI high performers are more likely than others are to expect a 
meaningful change, either in the form of workforce reductions or increases.

McKinsey commentary
Lareina Yee
Senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director
As many companies are still in pilot and early production phases of AI use, it is not yet clear 
what impact AI will have on the number of jobs and nature of work. Still, even in these early 
days of adoption, we are seeing changes in the skills demanded for a range of jobs. Across 
positions like claims adjusters, digital marketers, and wealth managers, we are seeing 
increasing demand for AI skills; typically, this is about incorporating AI into existing roles 
or workflows. In terms of how AI will affect head count, about a third of respondents say 
they expect their organization’s workforce to decline in size—though interestingly, a small 
percentage of respondents say they expect their organization’s head count to increase, and 
some report head count increases over the past year across functions as diverse as IT, supply 
chain, and sales. Some of these jobs will become more critical as AI adoption increases. AI 
success, for example, requires data readiness and MLOps. We see larger companies in 
particular hiring for those skills; they are twice as likely to hire roles that integrate, model, 
and industrialize data. 
Efforts to mitigate AI risks are  
becoming more common as 
challenges materialize 
Over the past six years, our research has consistently found that few risks associated with the 
use of AI are mitigated by most respondents’ organizations. In our latest findings, the share 
of respondents reporting mitigation efforts for risks such as personal and individual privacy, 
explainability, organizational reputation, and regulatory compliance has grown since we last 
asked about risks associated with AI overall in 2022. (In 2023 and 2024, we asked specifically 
about gen AI–related risks.) Back in 2022, respondents reported acting to manage an average of 
two AI-related risks, compared with four risks today.
We also see that, largely, the risks that organizations are experiencing and are working to 
mitigate are connected: Respondents are more likely to say their organizations are mitigating 
each of the risks they have experienced consequences from. Overall, 51 percent of respondents 
from organizations using AI say their organizations have seen at least one instance of a negative 
consequence, with nearly one-third of all respondents reporting consequences stemming 
from AI inaccuracy (Exhibit 19). Inaccuracy is one of two risks that most respondents say their 
organizations are working to mitigate. However, the second-most-commonly-reported risk—
explainability—is not among the most commonly mitigated.
26
The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  
Respondents from AI high performers, who say their organizations have deployed twice as many 
AI use cases as others have, are more likely than others to report negative consequences—
particularly related to intellectual property infringement and regulatory compliance. High 
performers also try to protect against a larger number of risks. Exhibit 19

McKinsey commentary
Alexander Sukharevsky
Senior partner 
We know that AI high performers—respondents who say their organizations are deriving 
higher impact from their use of AI—tend to have more ambitious agendas than their peers. 
Interestingly, they are also more likely than their peers to report more , rather than fewer, 
negative consequences from AI use. This isn’t as counterintuitive as it might seem. After  
all, because they are more ambitious, AI high performers are likely to be using the technology 
in mission-critical contexts that require sensitive monitoring. They also report mitigating 
these risks at a higher rate than others, given that they are aware of them. Their ambition 
also has considerable upside: It helps explain why these organizations tend to outperform—
and offers an important lesson to those who are still struggling to realize value from  
their AI efforts. Approaching AI solely through the lens of efficiency, our survey suggests,  
is not enough. Achieving measurable results requires leaders to pursue a bold agenda, 
driven by innovation and transformation. That, we are learning, may be the true pathway to 
high performance. 
While the use of AI is now common, our new survey suggests that its full promise still remains 
ahead. Most organizations are still navigating the transition from experimentation to scaled 
deployment, and while they may be capturing value in some parts of the organization, they’re 
not yet realizing enterprise-wide financial impact. The experience of the highest-performing 
companies suggests a path forward. These organizations stand out for thinking beyond 
incremental efficiency gains: They treat AI as a catalyst to transform their organizations, 
redesigning workflows and accelerating innovation. As AI tools, including agents, improve and 
companies’ capabilities mature, the opportunity to embed AI more fully into the enterprise will 
offer organizations new ways to capture value and create competitive advantage.

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation  About the research  
The online survey was in the field from June 25 to July 29, 2025, and garnered responses 
from 1,993 participants in 105 nations representing the full range of regions, industries, 
company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Thirty-eight percent of respondents 
say they work for organizations with more than $1 billion in annual revenues. To adjust 
for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each 
respondent’s nation to global GDP.
