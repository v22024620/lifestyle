Key takeaways
— Value comes from end-to-end change. Broad productivity wins are table stakes. Impact 
comes from prioritizing the biggest growth problems and then solving them end to end in a 
domain.
— Reimagine workflows, not tools. Growth comes from mapping decisions and handoffs, and 
embedding agents where they change outcomes, not bolting them onto legacy steps.
— Scale with a new operating model. End-to-end transformation requires cross-functional 
human–AI teams, shared data products, and governance that treats agents like managed  
talent.
A global retailer sees demand for a top product surge in one region while inventory piles up in 
another. Within seconds, a team of AI agents reallocates ad spend, adjusts pricing, reroutes  
stock, and refreshes creative assets to offers that match shopper intent. In this scenario, what 
comes next is coordinated action triggered by customer signals, orchestrating business growth  
in real time.
This is not a fantasy scenario; it’s the new frontier of AI in growth functions. Agentic AI embeds 
automated reasoning directly into marketing, sales, and customer service workflows. We 
estimate that agentic AI will power more than 60 percent of the increased value that AI is  
expected to generate from deployments in marketing and sales.1 It’s no exaggeration to say that 
marketing and sales represent the tip of the spear when it comes to translating agentic AI’s 
potential into meaningful value.2
Early leaders are already seeing measurable impact. For example, according to McKinsey 
analysis, some Fortune 250 companies have estimated that they are seeing campaign creation 
and execution speed up 15-fold, driven by faster innovation cycles and process optimization.
The value from agentic AI comes from the tasks it is able to do. Unlike gen AI and chatbots that 
largely assist in the completion of marketing and sales tasks, AI agents can act, decide, and  
collaborate. They are able, for example, to optimize prices, advance leads, tailor offers and  
manage customer interactions end-to-end. As organizations deepen their adoption of agentic 
AI, gains can scale. Our analysis shows that effective and scaled agent deployments could 
deliver productivity improvements of  three to five percent annually and potentially lift growth by  
10 percent or more.
Most organizations, however, have yet to realize meaningful value from AI generally.  Nearly eight  
in ten report no significant bottom-line gains from AI generally, mostly due to constraints  
stemming from fragmented pilot programs, weak data, and insufficient governance foundations.  
The leaders breaking through and realizing value from AI are redesigning how growth happens  
by integrating AI agents into their workflows. From our experience across industries, 
organizations that are finding breakthroughs and turning agentic AI from promise into 
performance in marketing and sales are following four lessons:
1 Early applications show gen AI could unlock  $2.6 to $4.4 trillion in annual value, with as much as 20 percent of the expected 
productivity lift concentrated in marketing and sales.
2 Agentic AI is a system based on gen AI foundation models that can act in the real world and execute multistep processes. AI 
agents can automate and perform complex tasks, often using natural language processing, which would normally require human 
effort.

1. Go where the value is
Impact begins with identifying where agents can move the needle—whether in conversion, 
pricing precision, or customer engagement—and deploying them to accelerate those outcomes.
Consider personalization, where the opportunity is both proven and profound. McKinsey 
research shows that 71 percent of consumers expect personalized interactions, and 76 percent 
become frustrated when they don’t happen. AI-driven personalization can enhance customer 
satisfaction by 15 to 20 percent, increase revenue by 5 to 8 percent, and reduce the cost to 
serve by up to 30 percent.
Agentic AI makes this possible at scale, using contextual reasoning and real-time decisioning to 
refine offers, content, and experiences with each interaction. According to McKinsey analysis, a 
European insurer, for instance, reimagined its sales operation with AI agents that personalized 
campaigns across hundreds of microsegments, adapted scripts to buyer cues, and coached 
sales teams with real-time feedback. The result: conversion rates two to three times higher, 25 
percent shorter customer service call times, and continuous learning loops that manual reviews 
could never match.
Other organizations are using similar practices with AI to elevate customer experience by 
anticipating what each customer needs next and delivering it in the right moment. A US airline 
used predictive insights to tailor compensation for flight disruptions, differentiating between 
frequent fliers and occasional travelers. The resulting impact was a 210 percent improvement in 
targeting at-risk customers, an 800 percent rise in customer satisfaction, and a 59 percent 
reduction in churn among high-value travelers.
That same type of intelligence is also proving useful to enhancing pricing. Agentic AI can sense 
market shifts, model outcomes, and act instantly by adjusting prices or reallocating inventory in 
real time based on competitor moves, customer behavior, or demand forecasts. Airlines, for 
instance, are already using agentic AI to create personalized bundles that combine fares, 
seating, and add-on offers, updating prices dynamically based on live signals such as search 
trends, weather, and booking patterns.
2. Think in terms of workflows, not agents
Organizations realizing meaningful impact from agentic AI are going beyond simply deploying 
new agents to improve existing tasks; they are redesigning workflows . Agents enhance value 
creation when used to improve end-to-end processes and journeys through automation and 
coordination—their power is limited, however, when used to improve isolated steps. Enhancing 
product discovery, for example, delivers limited impact if purchasing and fulfillment remain slow 
or disjointed.
In traditional processes, work moves sequentially, often across departments: Marketing hands  
off to sales, service escalates to support, and pricing follows. Each of these functions has made  
Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 3
tremendous progress in recent years by incorporating digital and analytics capabilities, and 
agentic AI builds on those improvements by automating and orchestrating tasks across teams 
and functions. Overcoming the persistent challenges of coordination across complex operational 
silos and workflows can allow organizations to achieve faster cycle times, as well as greater 
consistency and responsiveness at a scale no level of human coordination could match.
Crucially, success calls for designing processes around agents—not bolting agents onto legacy 
processes. For example, rather than using agents to help customer service teams respond to 
complaints faster, leading organizations use agents to predict potential issues, trigger outreach 
before a customer calls, and resolve cases pre-emptively with personalized offers.
The European insurer offers a clear view of what this looks like in practice. According to 
McKinsey analysis, in just 16 weeks, the company re-architected its commercial model around a 
connected network of agents working across the full customer journey. The improvements 
generated included the following:
— Knowledge agents centralized over 1,000 policy and product documents, enabling frontline 
staff to retrieve accurate answers instantly.
—Coaching agents introduced AI-driven call transcription and grading, automatically reviewing 
95 percent of sales calls versus 3 percent previously.
—Integration agents connected these capabilities into the existing CRM and agent 
portal—adhering to single-sign-on security policies and providing real-time performance 
dashboards.
Together, these agentic systems shortened average call times by 25 percent, reduced manual 
cross-functional handoffs, and created a continuous feedback loop. As agents learned from 
each engagement, they continually refined next-best actions, message sequencing, and product 
pairing to stay aligned with evolving customer needs.
Value creation with AI agents for end-to-end change depends, however, on matching the right 
agent to the right task: domain-specific agents that handle complex, contextual actions; 
generalist agents for tasks such as data synthesis or content generation; agents that check for 
errors; and orchestration agents that direct and synchronize the system as a whole.
Humans have a crucial role in this effort. They can work closely with agents to supervise and 
verify, as well as manage issues that AI agents escalate to them. The most advanced 
organizations combine these human–agent collaborations into adaptive workflows that evolve 
with each iteration and customer signal.

3.Build collaborative agents, not just add-on tools
To scale agentic AI, organizations need to stop thinking of agents as add-on tools and start 
treating them as collaborative, digital partners. That means defining the agents’ roles, 
onboarding them properly, and managing them with clear performance expectations—not unlike 
human team members.
The right metrics for measuring AI agents’ performance differ from traditional productivity KPIs, 
however. Rather than focusing on call counts or campaign volume, for example, leading 
organizations track a mix of indicators such as conversation quality, task-completion accuracy,  
escalation precision, and learning velocity, reflecting how effectively agents incorporate 
feedback and adapt to changing buyer cues. Because every agent action is logged and 
traceable, these metrics can be monitored continuously. Real-time dashboards surface 
performance drift, benchmark outcomes against human baselines, and flag when retraining or 
recalibration is needed.
A leading US homebuilder demonstrates how this discipline translates into impact. Seeking to 
improve digital engagement and appointment conversion, the company trained AI sales agents 
to emulate its top-performing human sellers. McKinsey analysis of more than 500,000 sales 
transcripts revealed dozens of conversation states—greeting, objection handling, follow-up, 
close—and the patterns most associated with success. Using these insights, the team 
developed agent personas with unique styles, tempos, and conversational approaches.
Every AI-led conversation was then benchmarked against human baselines using a scoring 
agent that evaluated accuracy, personalization, and flow. Dashboards highlighted drop-off 
points and tone mismatches, enabling rapid tuning. Conversion-to-appointment rates tripled, 
weekly appointments doubled, and the best-performing agents reached human-level parity in 
empathy and flow.
4.Build the agentic growth organization
As agents take on workflows that cut across marketing, sales, and customer service, companies 
need to rethink how growth is organized. The traditional model where each function operates in 
its own silo is giving way to an integrated system where agents coordinate activities, share data, 
and connect the entire customer journey from awareness to loyalty. Campaign design, lead 
conversion, and customer engagement are no longer sequential steps but parts of a single, 
learning loop.
This shift requires a new, hybrid human–AI operating model. In this system, agents handle 
orchestration and execution, while humans provide strategy, creativity, and oversight. Growth 
teams become cross-functional by design, with marketers, sellers, customer service reps, and 
data scientists collaborating around shared workflows and common KPIs. Agents are reused 
across functions rather than duplicated: One agent that fetches customer data can support 
campaign planning, sales calls, or post-purchase service interactions.

Without effective governance and an agentic architecture, however, this scale can lead to 
“agent chaos” through redundant builds, inconsistent quality, and unmanaged risk. To scale 
effectively, leading companies are standing up agent factories: dedicated hubs that industrialize 
how agents are built, deployed, and governed. These hubs standardize reusable blueprints, 
shared data products, and guardrails for security and compliance. And the standardized agents 
they build are assigned clear, role-based responsibilities, so that lead agents orchestrate work, 
practitioner agents execute tasks, and QA and compliance agents monitor performance.
Several global banks exemplify this approach, standing up agent factories to transform their 
due-diligence processes. Each factory deploys agent squads to handle discrete steps, from data 
extraction to validation and quality assurance, reducing manual work while improving accuracy 
and control.
A leading North American manufacturer of outdoor lifestyle products applied similar principles 
to customer service. According to McKinsey analysis, after analyzing more than 30,000 service 
tickets and call transcripts, the company redesigned the function so agents handle diagnosis, 
data retrieval, and summarization, while humans focus on empathy and resolution. Adoption 
succeeded through a tailored change-management program that included leaders being trained 
on KPI dashboards, frontline staff receiving job aids for AI-assisted workflows, and technical 
teams learning model maintenance and tuning. Continuous feedback loops and shared 
dashboards keep both human and digital agents aligned to drive faster resolution times, higher 
satisfaction, and measurable revenue uplift.
As these systems mature, the differentiator becomes human capability. The role of people shifts 
from completing tasks to supervising, refining, and improving how the work gets done. 
Managers and specialists must learn to delegate to agents, review outputs, identify exceptions, 
and guide learning loops. Emerging skills—such as prompt design, outcome tracking, and 
escalation management—are fast becoming core to modern growth roles. Many organizations 
already target 25 to 50 percent of employees to work regularly with agentic AI—a clear signal 
that fluency in collaborating with AI is becoming a defining business capability.
One year into the agentic AI era, the lesson is clear: growth won’t come from tools alone but 
from how leaders choose to build and deploy them. Competitive advantage will depend not on 
how many agents a company launches but on how effectively they are designed, managed, and 
scaled. The companies pulling ahead are already putting new mindsets into practice.
This is only the beginning of the change that agentic AI will bring—larger questions will soon 
loom, including:
—When your sales agent negotiates with your customer’s buying agent, how will your 
Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 6company differentiate itself?
— If execution becomes commoditized, what will your brand stand for?
— As workflows span silos, how will you ensure accountability and control?
These are the leadership tests of the agentic era. Very soon the central question for leaders will 
move on from “what can this agent do for us” to “what outcomes am I prepared to deliver with it, 
and how can I best use the space it creates to allow humans to do what only they can do even 
better?” The sooner that organizations can embed agentic AI into their marketing, sales, and 
customer support operations, the sooner they will be able to answer those larger questions.
