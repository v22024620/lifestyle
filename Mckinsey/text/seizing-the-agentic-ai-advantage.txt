Foreword
by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI 
We’re at a moment when gen AI has entered every boardroom, but for many enterprises, it still lingers at 
the edges of actual impact. Many CEOs have greenlit experiments, spun up copilots, and created promising 
prototypes, but only a handful have seen the needle move on revenue or impact. This report gets to the 
heart of that paradox: broad adoption with limited return. 
The current diagnosis is this: Today, AI is bolted on. But to deliver real impact, it must be integrated into core 
processes, becoming a catalyst for business transformation rather than a sidecar tool. Most deployments 
today use AI in a shallow way—as an assistant that sits alongside existing workflows and processes—rather 
than as a deeply integrated, engaged, and powerful agent of transformation. 
Agentic AI is the catalyst that can make this transition possible, but doing so requires a strategy and a 
plan to successfully power that transformation. Agents are not simply magical plug-n-play pieces. They 
must work across systems, reason through ambiguity, and interact with people—not just as tools, but as 
collaborators. That means CEOs must ask different questions: not “How do we add AI?” but “How do we 
want decisions to be made, work to flow, and humans to engage in an environment where software can act?” 
Redefining how decisions are made, how work is done, and how humans engage with technology requires 
alignment across goals, tools, and people. That alignment can only happen when openness, transparency, 
and control are central to your technology and implementation—when builders have an open, extensible, 
and observable infrastructure and users can easily craft and use agents with the confidence that the work 
of agents is safe, reliable, and under their control. That alignment creates the trust and effectiveness that is 
the currency of scalable transformation that delivers results rather than regrets. 
The technology to build powerful agents is already here. The opportunity now is to deploy agents in ways 
that are deeply tied to how value is created and how people work. That requires an architecture that is 
modular and resilient and, more importantly, an operating model that centers on humans—not just as users 
but as co-architects of the systems they will be living and working with. 
This report lays out the playbook not for tinkering but for reinvention. ROI comes from strong intent: 
define the outcomes, embed agents deep in core workflows, and redesign operating models around them. 
Organizations that win will pair a clear strategy with tight feedback loops and disciplined governance,  
using agents to rethink how decisions are made and how work gets done—and turning novelty into 
measurable value.

At a glance
 —Nearly eight in ten companies report using gen AI—yet just as many report no significant bottom-line impact.¹  
Think of it as the “gen AI paradox.” 
 —At the heart of this paradox is an imbalance between “horizontal” (enterprise-wide) copilots and chatbots—
which have scaled quickly but deliver diffuse, hard-to-measure gains—and more transformative “vertical” 
(function-specific) use cases—about 90 percent of which remain stuck in pilot mode.
 —AI agents offer a way to break out of the gen AI paradox. That’s because agents have the potential to automate 
complex business processes—combining autonomy, planning, memory, and integration—to shift gen AI from a 
reactive tool to a proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator. 
 —This shift enables far more than efficiency. Agents supercharge operational agility and create new revenue 
opportunities. 
 —But unlocking the full potential of agentic AI requires more than plugging agents into existing workflows. It 
calls for reimagining those workflows from the ground up—with agents at the core.
 —A new AI architecture paradigm—the agentic AI mesh—is needed to govern the rapidly evolving organizational 
AI landscape and enable teams to blend custom-built and off-the-shelf agents while managing mounting 
technical debt and new classes of risk. But the bigger challenge won’t be technical. It will be human: earning 
trust, driving adoption, and establishing the right governance to manage agent autonomy and prevent 
uncontrolled sprawl.
 —To scale impact in the agentic era, organizations must reset their AI transformation approaches from scattered 
initiatives to strategic programs; from use cases to business processes; from siloed AI teams to cross-
functional transformation squads; and from experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery. 
 —Organizations will also need to set up the foundation to effectively operate in the agentic era. They will need to 
upskill the workforce, adapt the technology infrastructure, accelerate data productization, and deploy agent-
specific governance mechanisms. The moment has come to bring the gen AI experimentation chapter to a 
close—a pivot only the CEO can make.

Key points: 
The gen AI paradox: 
Widespread 
deployment, 
minimal impactGen AI is everywhere—except in company P&L 
Even before the advent of gen AI, artificial intelligence had already carved out a key place in the enterprise, 
powering advanced prediction, classification, and optimization capabilities. And the technology’s estimated 
value potential was already immense—between $11 trillion and $18 trillion globally3—mainly in the fields of 
marketing (powering capabilities such as personalized email targeting and customer segmentation), sales 
(lead scoring), and supply chain (inventory optimization and demand forecasting). Yet AI was largely the 
domain of experts. As a result, adoption across the rank and file tended to be slow. From 2018 to 2022, 
for example, AI adoption remained relatively stagnant, with about 50 percent of companies deploying the 
technology in just one business function, according to McKinsey research (Exhibit 1). 
Gen AI has extended the reach of traditional AI in three breakthrough areas: information synthesis, content 
generation, and communication in human language. McKinsey estimates that the technology has the 
potential to unlock $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in additional value on top of the value potential of traditional 
analytical AI.4 
Two and a half years after the launch of ChatGPT, gen AI has reshaped how enterprises engage with AI. Its 
potentially transformative power lies not only in the new capabilities gen AI introduces but also in its ability 
to democratize access to advanced AI technologies across organizations. This democratization has led to 
widespread growth in awareness of, and experimentation with, AI: According to McKinsey’s most recent 
Global Survey on AI,5 more than 78 percent of companies are now using gen AI in at least one business 
function (up from 55 percent a year earlier). 
However, this enthusiasm has yet to translate into tangible economic results. More than 80 percent of 
companies still report no material contribution to earnings from their gen AI initiatives.6 What’s more, only

report no material impact on earnings.² We call this the “gen AI paradox.”
• The main issue is an imbalance between “horizontal” and “vertical” use cases. The former, such 
as employee copilots and chatbots, have been widely deployed but deliver diffuse benefits, while 
higher-impact vertical, or function-specific, use cases seldom make it out of the pilot phase because 
of technical, organizational, data, and cultural barriers.   
• Unless companies address these barriers, the transformational promise of gen AI will remain largely 
untapped.

For all the energy, investment, and potential surrounding the technology, at-scale impact has yet to

At the heart of the gen AI paradox lies an imbalance between horizontal and 
vertical use cases
Many organizations have deployed horizontal use cases, such as enterprise-wide copilots and chatbots; 
nearly 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, for example, use Microsoft 365 Copilot.8 These tools are 
widely seen as levers to enhance individual productivity by helping employees save time on routine tasks 
and access and synthesize information more efficiently. But these improvements, while real, tend to be 
spread thinly across employees. As a result, they are not easily visible in terms of top- or bottom-line 
results.

7 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
By contrast, vertical use cases—those embedded into specific business functions and processes—have 
seen limited scaling in most companies despite their higher potential for direct economic impact (Exhibit 
2). Fewer than 10 percent of use cases deployed ever make it past the pilot stage, according to McKinsey 
research.9  Even when they have been fully deployed, these use cases typically have supported only isolated 
steps of a business process and operated in a reactive mode when prompted by a human, rather than 
functioning proactively or autonomously. As a result, their impact on business performance also has been 
limited.

8 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
What accounts for this imbalance? For one thing, horizontally deployed copilots such as Microsoft Copilot or 
Google AI Workspace are accessible, off-the-shelf solutions that are relatively easy to implement. (In many cases, 
enabling Microsoft Copilot is as simple as activating an extension to an existing Office 365 contract, requiring no 
redesign of workflows or major change management efforts.) Rapid deployment of enterprise chatbots also has 
been driven by risk mitigation concerns. As employees began experimenting with external large language models 
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT, many organizations implemented internal, secure alternatives to limit data leakage and 
ensure compliance with corporate security policies.
The limited deployment and narrow scope of vertical use cases can in turn be attributed to six primary factors: 
 —Fragmented initiatives. At many companies, vertical use cases have been identified through a bottom-up, 
highly granular approach within individual functions. In fact, fewer than 30 percent of companies report that 
their CEOs sponsor their AI agenda directly.10 This has led to a proliferation of disconnected micro-initiatives 
and a dispersion of AI investments, with limited coordination at the enterprise level.
 —Lack of mature, packaged solutions. Unlike off-the-shelf horizontal applications, such as copilots, vertical use 
cases often require custom development. As a result, teams are frequently forced to build from scratch, using 
emerging, fast-evolving technologies they have limited experience with. While many companies have invested 
in data scientists to develop AI models, they often lack MLOps engineers, who are critical to industrialize, 
deploy, and maintain those models in production environments.
 —Technological limitations of LLMs.  Despite their impressive capabilities, the first generation of LLMs faced 
limitations that significantly constrained their deployment at enterprise scale. First, LLMs can produce 
inaccurate outputs, which makes them difficult to trust in environments where precision and repeatability are 
essential. What’s more, despite their power, LLMs are fundamentally passive; they do not act unless prompted 
and cannot independently drive workflows or make decisions without human initiation. LLMs also have 
struggled to handle complex workflows involving multiple steps, decision points, or branching logic. Finally, 
many current LLMs have limited persistent memory, making it difficult to track context over time or operate 
coherently across extended interactions.
 —Siloed AI teams. AI centers of excellence have played a crucial role in accelerating awareness and 
experimentation across many organizations. However, in many cases, these teams have operated in silos—
developing AI models independently from core IT, data, or business functions. This autonomy, while useful 
for rapid prototyping, has often made solutions difficult to scale because of poor integration with enterprise 
systems, fragmented data pipelines, or a lack of operational alignment.
 —Data accessibility and quality gaps. These gaps tend to exist for both structured and unstructured data, with 
unstructured material remaining largely ungoverned in most organizations. 
 —Cultural apprehension and organizational inertia.  In many organizations, AI deployments have encountered 
implicit resistance from business teams and middle management due to fear of disruption, uncertainty around 
job impact, and lack of familiarity with the technology.

Despite its limited bottom-line impact so far, the first wave of gen AI has been far from wasted. It has 
enriched employee capabilities and enabled broad experimentation, accelerated AI familiarity across 
functions, and helped organizations build essential capabilities in prompt engineering, model evaluation, and 
governance. All of which has laid the groundwork for a more integrated and transformative second phase—
the emerging age of AI agents.11

The breakthrough: Automating complex business workflows unlocks the full 
potential of vertical use cases
LLMs have revolutionized how organizations interact with data—enabling information synthesis, content 
generation, and natural language interaction. But despite their power, LLMs have been fundamentally 
reactive and isolated from enterprise systems, largely unable to retain memory of past interactions 
or context across sessions or queries. Their role has been largely limited to enhancing individual 
productivity through isolated tasks. AI agents mark a major evolution in enterprise AI—extending gen AI 
from reactive content generation to autonomous, goal-driven execution. Agents can understand goals, 
break them into subtasks, interact with both humans and systems, execute actions, and adapt in real 
time—all with minimal human intervention. They do so by combining LLMs with additional technology 
components providing memory, planning, orchestration, and integration capabilities. 
With these new capabilities, AI agents expand the potential of horizontal solutions, upgrading general-
purpose copilots from passive tools into proactive teammates that don’t just respond to prompts but also 
monitor dashboards, trigger workflows, follow up on open actions, and deliver relevant insights in real 
time. But the real breakthrough comes in the vertical realm, where agentic AI enables the automation 
of complex business workflows involving multiple steps, actors, and systems—processes that were 
previously beyond the capabilities of first-generation gen AI tools. 
Agents deliver more than efficiency—they supercharge operational agility and 
unlock new revenue opportunities
On the operations side, agents take on routine, data-heavy tasks so humans can focus on higher-value 
work. But they go further, transforming processes in five ways: 
 —Agents accelerate execution by eliminating delays between tasks and by enabling parallel 
processing.  Unlike in traditional workflows that rely on sequential handoffs, agents can coordinate 
and execute multiple steps simultaneously, reducing cycle time and boosting responsiveness.Key points: 
• By automating complex business workflows, agents unlock the full potential of vertical use cases. 
Forward-looking companies are already harnessing the power of agents to transform core processes. 
• To realize the potential of agents, companies must reinvent the way work gets done—changing task 
flows, redefining human roles, and building agent-centric processes from the ground up. 
• Accomplishing this will require a new paradigm for AI architecture—the agentic AI mesh—capable of 
integrating both custom-built and off-the-shelf agents. But the bigger challenge will not be technical. It 
will be human: earning trust to drive adoption and establishing the proper governance protocols. 
12 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
 —Agents bring adaptability. By continuously ingesting data, agents can adjust process flows on the 
fly, reshuffling task sequences, reassigning priorities, or flagging anomalies before they cascade into 
failures. This makes workflows not only faster but smarter.
 —Agents enable personalization.  By tailoring interactions and decisions to individual customer profiles 
or behaviors, agents can adapt the process dynamically to maximize satisfaction and outcomes. 
 —Agents bring elasticity to operations. Because agents are digital, their execution capacity can 
expand or contract in real time depending on workload, business seasonality, or unexpected surges—
something difficult to achieve with fixed human resource models. 
 —Agents also make operations more resilient. By monitoring disruptions, rerouting operations, and 
escalating only when needed, they keep processes running—whether it’s supply chains navigating port 
delays or service workflows adapting to system outages.
In a complex supply chain environment, for example, an AI agent could act as an autonomous orchestration 
layer across sourcing, warehousing, and distribution operations. Connected to internal systems (such as 
the supply chain planning system or the warehouse management system) and external data sources (such 
as weather forecasts, supplier feeds, and demand signals), the agent could continuously forecast demand. 
It could then identify risks, such as delays or disruptions, and dynamically replan transport and inventory 
flows. Selecting the optimal transport mode based on cost, lead time, and environmental impact, the 
agent could reallocate stock across warehouses, negotiate directly with external systems, and escalate 
decisions requiring strategic input. The result: improved service levels, reduced logistics costs, and lower 
emissions.
Agents can also help spur top-line growth by amplifying existing revenue streams and unlocking entirely 
new ones:
 —Amplifying existing revenues. In e-commerce, agents embedded into online stores or apps could 
proactively analyze user behavior, cart content, and context (for example, seasonality or purchase 
history) to surface real-time upselling and cross-selling offers. In finance, agents might help customers 
discover suitable financial products such as loans, insurance plans, or investment portfolios, providing 
tailored guidance based on financial profiles, life events, and user behavior.
 —Creating new revenue streams. For industrial companies, agents embedded in connected products or 
equipment could monitor usage, detect performance thresholds, and autonomously unlock features 
or trigger maintenance actions—enabling pay-per-use, subscription, or performance-based models 
of creating revenue. Similarly, service organizations could encapsulate internal expertise—legal 
reasoning, tax interpretation, and procurement best practices—into AI agents offered as software-as-
a-service tools or APIs to clients, partners, or smaller businesses lacking in-house expertise.
In short, agentic AI doesn’t just automate. It redefines how organizations operate, adapt, and create value.

No longer science fiction: Forward-looking companies are harnessing  
the power of agents
The following case studies demonstrate how QuantumBlack helps organizations build agent workforces—with 
outcomes that extend far beyond efficiency gains.
Case study 1: How a bank used hybrid ‘digital factories’ for legacy app modernization 
The problem: A large bank needed to modernize its legacy core system, which consisted of 400 pieces of 
software—a massive undertaking budgeted at more than $600 million. Large teams of coders tackled the 
project using manual, repetitive tasks, which resulted in difficulty coordinating across silos. They also relied 
on often slow, error-prone documentation and coding. While first-generation gen AI tools helped accelerate 
individual tasks, progress remained slow and laborious. 
The agentic approach: Human workers were elevated to supervisory roles, overseeing squads of AI agents, 
each contributing to a shared objective in a defined sequence (Exhibit 3). These squads retroactively document 
the legacy application, write new code, review the code of other agents, and integrate code into features 
that are later tested by other agents prior to delivery of the end product. Freed from repetitive, manual tasks, 
human supervisors guide each stage of the process, enhancing the quality of deliverables and reducing the 
number of sprints required to implement new features.
Impact:  More than 50 percent reduction in time and effort in the early adopter teams
Case study 2: How a research firm boosted data quality to derive deeper market insights 
The problem: A market research and intelligence firm was devoting substantial resources to ensure data 
quality, relying on a team of more than 500 people whose responsibilities included gathering data, structuring 
and codifying it, and generating tailored insights for clients. The process, conducted manually, was prone to 
error, with a staggering 80 percent of mistakes identified by the clients themselves.Exhibit 3  Web <2025>

The agentic approach:  A multiagent solution autonomously identifies data anomalies and explains shifts in sales 
or market share. It analyzes internal signals, such as changes in product taxonomy, and external events identified 
via web searches, including product recalls or severe weather. The most influential drivers are synthesized, 
ranked, and prepared for decision-makers. With advanced search and contextual reasoning, the agents often 
surface insights that would be difficult for human analysts to uncover manually. While not yet in production, the 
system is fully functional and has demonstrated strong potential to free up analysts for more strategic work.
Impact: More than 60 percent potential productivity gain and expected savings of more than $3 million annually
Case study 3: How a bank reimagined the way it creates credit-risk memos 
The problem: Relationship managers (RMs) at a retail bank were spending weeks writing and iterating credit-risk 
memos to help make credit decisions and fulfill regulatory requirements (Exhibit 4). This process required RMs to 
manually review and extract information from at least ten different data sources and develop complex nuanced 
reasoning across interdependent sections—for instance, loan, revenue, and cash joint evolution.  
 
The agentic approach:  In close collaboration with the bank’s credit-risk experts and RMs, a proof of concept 
was developed to transform the credit memo workflow using AI agents. The agents assist RMs by extracting 
data, drafting memo sections, generating confidence scores to prioritize review, and suggesting relevant follow-
up questions. In this model, the analyst’s role shifts from manual drafting to strategic oversight and exception 
handling.
Impact:  A potential 20 to 60 percent increase in productivity, including a 30 percent improvement in credit 
turnaround

Maximizing value from AI agents requires process reinvention
Realizing AI’s full potential in the vertical realm requires more than simply inserting agents into legacy 
workflows. It instead calls for a shift in design mindset—from automating tasks within an existing process 
to reinventing the entire process with human and agentic coworkers. That’s because when agents are 
embedded into a legacy process without redesign, they typically serve as faster assistants—generating 
content, retrieving data, or executing predefined steps. But the process itself remains sequential, rule 
bound, and shaped by human constraints.
Reinventing a process around agents means more than layering automation on top of existing 
workflows—it involves rearchitecting the entire task flow from the ground up. That includes reordering 
steps, reallocating responsibilities between humans and agents, and designing the process to fully 
exploit the strengths of agentic AI: parallel execution that collapses cycle time, real-time adaptability that 
reacts to changing conditions, deep personalization at scale, and elastic capacity that flexes instantly 
with demand. 
Consider a hypothetical customer call center. Before introducing AI agents, the facility was using gen 
AI tools to assist human support staff by retrieving articles from knowledge bases, summarizing ticket 
histories, and helping draft responses. While this assistance improved speed and reduced cognitive load, 
the process itself remained entirely manual and reactive, with human agents still managing every step 
of diagnosis, coordination, and resolution. The productivity improvement potential was modest, typically 
boosting resolution time and productivity between 5 and 10 percent. 
Now imagine that the call center introduces AI agents but largely preserves the existing workflow—
agents are added to assist at specific steps without reconfiguring how work is routed, tracked, or 
resolved end-to-end. Agents can classify tickets, suggest likely root causes, propose resolution paths, 
and even autonomously resolve frequent, low-complexity issues (such as password resets). While the 
impact here can be increased—an estimated 20 to 40 percent savings in time and a 30 to 50 percent 
reduction in backlog—coordination friction and limited adaptability prevent true breakthrough gains.
But the real shift occurs at the third level, when the call center’s process is reimagined around agent 
autonomy. In this model, AI agents don’t just respond—they proactively detect common customer 
issues (such as delayed shipments, failed payments, or service outages) by monitoring patterns across 
channels, anticipate likely needs, initiate resolution steps automatically (such as issuing refunds, 
reordering items, or updating account details), and communicate directly with customers via chat or 
email. Human agents are repositioned as escalation managers and service quality overseers, who are 
brought in only when agents detect uncertainty or exceptions to typical patterns. Impact at this level is 
transformative. This could allow a radical improvement of customer service desk productivity. Up to 80 
percent of common incidents could be resolved autonomously, with a reduction in time to resolution of 60 
to 90 percent (Exhibit 5).
Of course, not every business process requires full reinvention. Simple task automation is sufficient 
for highly standard, repetitive workflows with limited variability—such as payroll processing, travel 
expense approvals, or password resets—where gains come primarily from reducing manual effort. In 
contrast, processes that are complex, cross-functional, prone to exceptions, or tightly linked to business 
performance often warrant full redesign. Key indicators that call for reinvention include high coordination 
overhead, rigid sequences that delay responsiveness, frequent human intervention for decisions that 
could be data driven, and opportunities for dynamic adaptation or personalization. In these cases, 
redesigning the process around the agent’s ability to orchestrate, adapt, and learn delivers far greater 
value than simply speeding up existing workflows.
16 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
A new AI architecture paradigm—the agentic AI mesh—is required to 
orchestrate value in the agentic era  
To scale agents, companies will need to overcome a threefold challenge: handling the newfound risks 
that AI agents bring, blending custom and off-the-shelf agentic systems, and staying agile amid fast-
evolving tech (while avoiding lock-ins).
 —Managing a new wave of risks. Agents introduce a new class of systemic risks that traditional 
gen AI architectures, designed primarily for isolated LLM-centric use cases, were never built to 
handle: uncontrolled autonomy, fragmented system access, lack of observability and traceability, 
expanding surface of attack, and agent sprawl and duplication. What starts as intelligent automation 
can quickly become operational chaos—unless it is built on a foundation that prioritizes control, 
scalability, and trust.
 —Blending custom and off-the-shelf agents. To fully capture the transformative potential of AI 
agents, organizations must go beyond simply activating agents embedded in software suites. These 
off-the-shelf agents may streamline routine workflows, but they rarely unlock strategic advantage. 
Realizing the full potential of agentic AI will require the development of custom-built agents for high-
impact processes, such as end-to-end customer resolution, adaptive supply chain orchestration, 
or complex decision-making. These agents must be deeply aligned with the company’s logic, data 
flows, and value creation levers—making them difficult to replicate and uniquely powerful.
 —Staying agile amid fast-evolving tech. Agentic AI is a new technology area, and solutions are 
evolving very rapidly. Agents will have to support workflows across multiple systems and should not 
be hardwired within a specific platform. An evolutive and vendor-agnostic architecture is therefore 
needed. Exhibit 5

These challenges cannot be addressed by merely bolting new components, such as memory stores or 
orchestration engines, on top of existing gen AI stacks. While such capabilities are necessary, they are 
not sufficient. What’s needed is a fundamental architectural shift: from static, LLM-centric infrastructure 
to a dynamic, modular, and governed environment built specifically for agent-based intelligence—the 
agentic AI mesh.
The agentic AI mesh is a composable, distributed, and vendor-agnostic architectural paradigm that 
enables multiple agents to reason, collaborate, and act autonomously across a wide array of systems, 
tools, and language models—securely, at scale, and built to evolve with the technology. At the heart of 
this paradigm are five mutually reinforcing design principles:
 —Composability. Any agent, tool, or LLM can be plugged into the mesh without system rework.
 —Distributed intelligence.  Tasks can be decomposed and resolved by networks of cooperating agents.
 —Layered decoupling.  Logic, memory, orchestration, and interface functions are decoupled to 
maximize modularity.
 —Vendor neutrality. All components can be independently updated or replaced as technology 
advances, avoiding vendor lock-in and future-proofing the architecture. In particular, open standards 
such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) are preferred to proprietary 
protocols.
 —Governed autonomy.  Agent behavior is proactively controlled via embedded policies, permissions, 
and escalation mechanisms that ensure safe, transparent operation.
The agentic AI mesh acts as the connective and orchestration layer that enables large-scale, intelligent 
agent ecosystems to operate safely and efficiently, and continuously evolve. It allows companies to 
coordinate custom-built and off-the-shelf agents within a unified framework, support multiagent 
collaboration by allowing agents to share context and delegate tasks, and mitigate key risks such as 
agent sprawl, autonomy drift, and lack of observability—all while preserving the agility required for a rapid 
technology evolution (see sidebar “Seven interconnected capabilities of the AI agentic mesh”). 
Beyond this architectural evolution, organizations will also have to revisit their LLM strategies. At the core 
of every custom agent lies a foundation model—the reasoning engine that powers perception, decision-
making, and interaction. In the agentic era, the requirements placed on LLMs evolve significantly. Agents 
are not passive copilots—they are autonomous, persistent, embedded systems. This creates five critical 
categories of LLM requirements, each aligned with specific deployment contexts, for which different 
kinds of models will be relevant (see sidebar “Foundational models for agents: Five requirements”).
Finally, to truly scale agent deployment across the enterprise, the enterprise systems themselves must 
also evolve. 
In the short term, APIs—protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and 
exchange data—will remain the primary interface for agents to interact with enterprise systems. But in 
the long term, APIs alone will not suffice. Organizations must begin reimagining their IT architectures 
around an agent-first model—one in which user interfaces, logic, and data access layers are natively 
designed for machine interaction rather than human navigation. In such a model, systems are no longer 
organized around screens and forms but around machine-readable interfaces, autonomous workflows, 
and agent-led decision flows.
18 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
This shift is already underway. Microsoft is embedding agents into the core of Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 
365 via Copilot Studio; Salesforce is expanding Agentforce into a multiagent orchestration layer; SAP is 
rearchitecting its Business Technology Platform (BTP) to support agent integration through Joule. These 
changes signal a broader transition: The future of enterprise software is not just AI-augmented—it is agent-
native. 
The main challenge won’t be technical—it will be human
As agents evolve from passive copilots to proactive actors—and scale across the enterprise—the complexity 
they introduce will be not only technical but mostly organizational. The real challenge lies in coordination, 
judgment, and trust. This organizational complexity will play out most visibly across three dimensions: how 
humans and agents cohabit day-to-day workflows; how organizations establish governance over systems 
that can act autonomously; and how they prevent unchecked sprawl as agent creation becomes increasingly 
democratized.
 —Human–agent cohabitation. Agents won’t just assist humans—they’ll act alongside them. This raises 
nuanced questions about interaction and coexistence: When should an agent take initiative? When 
should it defer? How do we maintain human agency and oversight without slowing down the very 1. Agent and workflow discovery maintains a dynamic catalog 
of all organizational agents and workflows, enabling reuse 
across teams and enforcing policies on agent use.
2. AI asset registry centralizes governance of system 
prompts, agent instructions, large-language-model (LLM) 
configurations, tool definitions, and golden records while 
creating policies about version control and access.
3. Observability  provides end-to-end tracing of workflows 
spanning agentic and procedural systems through 
standardized metrics, audit logs, and diagnostic capabilities.
4. Authentication and authorization enforce fine-grain access 
controls for communication among agentic systems, procedural systems, and LLMs, enforcing security policies 
and limiting the “blast radius” of compromised systems or 
agents.
5. Evaluations  deliver comprehensive testing of agent pipelines 
to ensure accuracy and compliance over time.
6. Feedback management  enables continuous improvement 
through automated feedback loops that capture 
performance metrics to evolve agent configurations.
7. Compliance and risk management embed policy controls, 
compliance agents, and ethical guardrails to ensure 
workflows meet regulatory and institutional standards.
Seven interconnected capabilities of the AI agentic mesh 
The emerging architecture for agentic AI relies on seven interconnected capabilities:  
19 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
1. Low-latency inference for real-time responsiveness. 
Agents embedded in workflows (such as service operations 
or IT alerts) require subsecond response times with 
predictable latency, even under compute constraints. 
Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mistral Small 
(Mistral AI), Llama 3 8B (Meta), Gemini Nano (Google), and 
Claude Haiku (Anthropic).
2.  Fine-tuning and controllability for domain-specific agents. 
Agents operating in regulated or knowledge-intensive 
domains (such as finance, legal, and healthcare) need large 
language models (LLMs) that can be fine-tuned, grounded in 
enterprise knowledge, and instrumented with external tools 
(such as RAG and APIs). Illustrative examples of relevant 
models are Mistral Small and Mistral 8x7B (open weight 
and fine-tunable, Mistral AI), and Llama 3 8B and 70B (fine-
tunable, Meta).
3. Lightweight deployment for embedded and edge agents. 
In cases such as the Internet of Things, field devices, or 
privacy-sensitive environments, agents must be embedded 
directly into software or hardware, with minimal compute 
and memory footprint. Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mistral Small (Mistral AI), Gemini Nano 
(Google), Llama 3 8B (Meta), and Phi-2 (Microsoft).
4. Scalable multiagent orchestration across the enterprise. 
Enterprises deploying hundreds or thousands of agents 
require LLMs that can scale efficiently and cost-effectively, 
ideally using sparse architectures or a mixture of experts. 
Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mixtral  
(Mistral AI), Grok-1 (xAI), GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI), and 
Command R+ (Cohere).
5. Sovereignty, auditability, and geopolitical resilience 
for autonomous agents.  Agents embedded in core 
operations—particularly in public, financial, and critical-
infrastructure sectors—must ensure compliance, data 
sovereignty, traceability, and geopolitical autonomy. This 
includes avoiding reliance on APIs that are hosted abroad, 
ensuring data residency, and resisting extraterritorial legal 
exposure (for example, OpenAI or Anthropic subject to US 
subpoenas). Illustrative examples of relevant models include 
Mistral Small/Mixtral (Mistral AI), Falcon 180B (TII UAE), and 
BloomZ/Bloom (BigScience).Foundational models for agents: Five requirements
A few characteristics are key for LLM providers to take into account in the agentic era:
benefits agents bring? Building clarity around these roles will take time, experimentation, and cultural 
adjustment. Trust won’t come from technical performance alone—it will hinge on how transparently 
agents communicate, how predictably they behave, and how intuitively they integrate into daily 
workflows.
 —Autonomy control. What makes agents powerful—their ability to act independently—also introduces 
ambiguity. Unlike traditional tools, agents don’t wait to be instructed. They respond, adapt, and 
sometimes surprise. Navigating this new reality means confronting edge cases: What if an agent 
executes too aggressively? Or fails to escalate a subtle issue? The challenge is not to eliminate autonomy 
but to make it intelligible and aligned with organizational expectations. That alignment won’t be static. 
20 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
It will need to evolve as agents learn, systems shift, and trust deepens. Control mechanisms must also 
address the risk of hallucinations, or plausible but inaccurate outputs agents may produce.
 —Sprawl containment.  As in the early days of robotic process automation, there’s a real risk of agent 
sprawl—the uncontrolled proliferation of redundant, fragmented, and ungoverned agents across 
teams and functions. As low-code and no-code platforms make agent creation accessible to anyone, 
organizations risk a new kind of shadow IT: agents that multiply across teams, duplicate efforts, or 
operate without oversight. How do we avoid fragmentation? Who decides what gets built—and what 
gets retired? Without structured governance, design standards, and life cycle management, agent 
ecosystems can quickly become fragile, redundant, and unscalable.
Agents unlock the full potential of vertical use cases, offering companies a path to generate value well 
beyond efficiency gains. But realizing that potential requires a reimagined approach to AI transformation—
one tailored to the unique nature of agents and capable of addressing the lingering limitations they alone 
cannot resolve. This approach is the subject of our next chapter.

22 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
Key points: 
• Generating impact in the agentic era requires organizations to shift from scattered initiatives to 
strategic programs; from use cases to business processes; from siloed AI teams to cross-functional 
transformation squads; and from experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery.
• To scale agents, organizations will also need to set a new foundation by upskilling the workforce, adapting 
the technology infrastructure, and developing new governance structures for agents. 
• The time has come to bring the gen AI experimentation phase to an end—a pivot only the CEO can make.  
Scaling impact in the agentic era requires a reset of the AI  
transformation approach 
Unlike gen AI tools that could be easily plugged into existing workflows, AI agents demand a more 
foundational shift, one that requires rethinking business processes and enabling deep integration with 
enterprise systems. McKinsey has a proven Rewired playbook for digital transformations.12 To capitalize on 
the agentic opportunity, organizations must build on that, fundamentally reshaping their AI transformation 
approach across four dimensions:
 —Strategy: From scattered tactical initiatives to strategic programs. With agentic AI set to reshape the 
foundations of competition, organizations must move beyond bottom-up use case identification and 
directly align AI initiatives with their most critical strategic priorities. This means not only translating 
existing goals—such as enhancing operational efficiency, improving customer intimacy, or strengthening 
compliance—into AI-addressable transformation domains, but also adopting a forward-looking lens. 
Executives must challenge their organizations to look beyond the boundaries of today’s operating model 
and explore how AI can be used to reimagine entire segments of the business, create new revenue 
streams, and build competitive moats that will define leadership in the next decade. 
 —Unit of transformation: From use case to business processes. In the early wave of gen AI adoption, 
most vertical initiatives focused on plugging a solution into a specific step of an existing process—
which tended to deliver narrow gains without changing the overall structure of how work is done. With 
AI agents, the paradigm shifts entirely. Opportunity now lies not in optimizing isolated tasks but in 
transforming entire business processes by embedding agents throughout the value chain. As a result, 
AI initiatives should no longer be scoped around a single use case, but instead around the end-to-end 
reinvention of a full process or persona journey. In vertical domains, this means moving from the question, 
“Where can I use AI in this function?” to “What would this function look like if agents ran 60 percent of it?” 
It involves rethinking workflows, decision logic, human–system interactions, and performance metrics 
across the board.

23 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
 —Delivery model: From siloed AI teams to cross-functional transformation squads. AI centers 
of excellence have played a key role in accelerating AI awareness and experimentation across 
organizations. However, this model reaches its limits in the agentic era—in which agents are deeply 
embedded into enterprise systems, operate across complex business processes, and rely on high-
quality data as their primary fuel. In this context, AI initiatives can no longer be delivered by isolated, 
specialized AI teams. To succeed at scale, organizations must shift to a cross-functional delivery model, 
anchored in durable transformation squads composed of business domain experts, process designers, 
AI and MLOps engineers, IT architects, software engineers, and data engineers.
 —Implementation process: From experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery.  While the 
previous phase rightly focused on exploring the potential of gen AI, organizations must now shift to an 
industrialized delivery model, in which solutions are designed from the outset to scale, both technically 
and financially. This requires organizations to anticipate the full set of technical prerequisites for 
enterprise deployment—notably in terms of system integration, day-to-day monitoring, and release 
management, but also to rigorously estimate future running costs and design a solution to minimize 
them. Unlike traditional IT systems—for which annual run costs typically represent 10 to 20 percent of 
initial build costs13—gen AI solutions, especially at scale, can incur recurring costs that exceed the initial 
build investment. Designing for scalability must therefore include not just technical robustness but also 
economic sustainability, especially for high-volume applications.
Four critical enablers are required to effectively operate in the agentic era 
Redesigning the approach to AI transformation is an important step, but it is not enough. To unlock their 
full potential at scale, organizations must also activate a robust set of enablers that support the structural, 
cultural, and technical shifts required to integrate agents into day-to-day operations. These enablers span 
four dimensions—people, governance, technology architecture, and data—each of which is a foundation for 
scalable, secure, and high-impact deployment of agents across the enterprise.
 —People: Equip the workforce and introduce new roles. The workforce must be equipped for new ways 
of working driven by human–agent collaboration. This involves fostering a “human + agent” mindset 
through cultural change, targeted training, and supporting early adopters as internal champions. New 
roles must also be introduced, such as prompt engineers to refine interactions, agent orchestrators to 
manage agent workflows, and human-in-the-loop designers to handle exceptions and build trust.
 —Governance: Ensure autonomy control and prevent agent sprawl. With the rise of autonomous agents 
comes the need for strong governance to avoid risk and uncontrolled sprawl. Enterprises should 
define governance frameworks that establish agent autonomy levels, decision boundaries, behavior 
monitoring, and audit mechanisms. Policies for development, deployment, and usage must also be 
formalized, along with classification systems that group agents by function (such as task automators, 
domain orchestrators, and virtual collaborators), each with an appropriate oversight model.
 —Technology architecture: Build a foundation for interoperability and scale.  Agents, whether custom-
built or off-the-shelf, must operate across a fragmented ecosystem of systems, data, and workflows. In 
the short term, organizations must evolve their AI architecture from LLM-centric setups to an agentic

24 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
AI mesh. Beyond this first step, organizations should start preparing for their next-generation 
architecture, in which all enterprise systems will be reshuffled around agents in terms of user 
interface, business logic, and day-to-day operations.
 —Data: Accelerate data productization and address quality gaps in unstructured data. Finally, agents 
depend on the quality and accessibility of enterprise data. Organizations must transition from  
use-case-specific data pipelines to reusable data products and extend data governance to 
unstructured data.
CEOs have a leadership challenge: Bringing the gen AI experimentation  
phase to a close 
The rise of AI agents is more than just a technological shift. Agents represent a strategic inflection 
point that will redefine how companies operate, compete, and create value. To navigate this transition 
successfully, organizations must move beyond experimentation and pilot programs and enter a new 
phase of scaled, enterprise-wide transformation.
This pivot cannot be delegated—it must be initiated and led by the CEO. It will rely on three key actions: 
 —Action 1: Conclude the experimentation phase and realign AI priorities. Conduct a structured 
review to capture lessons learned, retire unscalable pilots, and formally close the exploratory phase. 
Refocus efforts on strategic AI programs targeting high-impact domains and processes. 
 —Action 2: Redesign the AI governance and operating model.  Set up a strategic AI council involving 
business leaders, the chief human resources officer, the chief data officer, and the chief information 
officer. This council should oversee AI direction-setting; coordinate AI, IT, and data investments; and 
implement rigorous value-tracking mechanisms based on KPIs tied to business outcomes. 
 —Action 3: Launch a first lighthouse transformation project and simultaneously initialize the 
agentic AI tech foundation. Kick off a select number of high-impact agentic AI–driven workflow 
transformations in core business areas. In parallel, lay the groundwork for an agentic AI technology 
foundation by investing in key enablers—technology infrastructure, data quality, governance 
frameworks, and workforce readiness.
25 Seizing the agentic AI advantage
Conclusion
Like any truly disruptive technology, AI agents have the power to reshuffle the deck. Done right, they offer 
laggards a leapfrog opportunity to rewire their competitiveness. Done wrong—or not at all—they risk 
accelerating the decline of today’s market leaders. This is a moment of strategic divergence.
While the technology will continue to evolve, it is already mature enough to drive real, transformative 
change across industries. But to realize the full promise of agentic AI, CEOs must rethink their approach 
to AI transformation—not as a series of scattered pilots but as focused, end-to-end reinvention efforts. 
That means identifying a few business domains with the highest potential and pulling every lever: from 
reimagining workflows to redistributing tasks between humans and machines to rewiring the organization 
based on new operating models.
Some leaders are already moving—not just by deploying fleets of agents but by rewiring their organizations 
to harness their full disruptive potential. (Moderna, for example, merged its HR and IT leadership14—
signaling that AI is not just a technical tool but a workforce-shaping force.) This is a structural move toward 
a new kind of enterprise. Agentic AI is not an incremental step—it is the foundation of the next-generation 
operating model. CEOs who act now won’t just gain a performance edge. They will redefine how their 
organizations think, decide, and execute.
The time for exploration is ending. The time for transformation is now.
