Broad productivity wins are table stakes. Impact comes from prioritizing the biggest growth problems and then solving them end to end in a domain. \u2014 Reimagine workflows, not tools. Growth comes from mapping decisions and handoffs, and embedding agents where they change outcomes, not bolting them onto legacy steps. \u2014 Scale with a new operating model. End-to-end transformation requires cross-functional human\u2013AI teams, shared data products, and governance that treats agents like managed talent. A global retailer sees demand for a top product surge in one region while inventory piles up in another. Within seconds, a team of AI agents reallocates ad spend, adjusts pricing, reroutes stock, and refreshes creative assets to offers that match shopper intent. In this scenario, what comes next is coordinated action triggered by customer signals, orchestrating business growth in real time. This is not a fantasy scenario; it\u2019s the new frontier of AI in growth functions. Agentic AI embeds automated reasoning directly into marketing, sales, and customer service workflows. We estimate that agentic AI will power more than 60 percent of the increased value that AI is expected to generate from deployments in marketing and sales.1 It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that marketing and sales represent the tip of the spear when it comes to translating agentic AI\u2019s potential into meaningful value.2 Early leaders are already seeing measurable impact. For example, according to McKinsey analysis, some Fortune 250 companies have estimated that they are seeing campaign creation and execution speed up 15-fold, driven by faster innovation cycles and process optimization. The value from agentic AI comes from the tasks it is able to do. Unlike gen AI and chatbots that largely assist in the completion of marketing and sales tasks, AI agents can act, decide, and collaborate. They are able, for example, to optimize prices, advance leads, tailor offers and manage customer interactions end-to-end. As organizations deepen their adoption of agentic AI, gains can scale. Our analysis shows that effective and scaled agent deployments could deliver productivity improvements of three to five percent annually and potentially lift growth by 10 percent or more. Most organizations, however, have yet to realize meaningful value from AI generally. Nearly eight in ten report no significant bottom-line gains from AI generally, mostly due to constraints stemming from fragmented pilot programs, weak data, and insufficient governance foundations. The leaders breaking through and realizing value from AI are redesigning how growth happens by integrating AI agents into their workflows. From our experience across industries, organizations that are finding breakthroughs and turning agentic AI from promise into performance in marketing and sales are following four lessons: 1 Early applications show gen AI could unlock $2.6 to $4.4 trillion in annual value, with as much as 20 percent of the expected productivity lift concentrated in marketing and sales. 2 Agentic AI is a system based on gen AI foundation models that can act in the real world and execute multistep processes. AI agents can automate and perform complex tasks, often using natural language processing, which would normally require human effort. Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 2 1. Go where the value is Impact begins with identifying where agents can move the needle\u2014whether in conversion, pricing precision, or customer engagement\u2014and deploying them to accelerate those outcomes. Consider personalization, where the opportunity is both proven and profound. McKinsey research shows that 71 percent of consumers expect personalized interactions, and 76 percent become frustrated when they don\u2019t happen. AI-driven personalization can enhance customer satisfaction by 15 to 20 percent, increase revenue by 5 to 8 percent, and reduce the cost to serve by up to 30 percent. Agentic AI makes this possible at scale, using contextual reasoning and real-time decisioning to refine offers, content, and experiences with each interaction. According to McKinsey analysis, a European insurer, for instance, reimagined its sales operation with AI agents that personalized campaigns across hundreds of microsegments, adapted scripts to buyer cues, and coached sales teams with real-time feedback. The result: conversion rates two to three times higher, 25 percent shorter customer service call times, and continuous learning loops that manual reviews could never match. Other organizations are using similar practices with AI to elevate customer experience by anticipating what each customer needs next and delivering it in the right moment. A US airline used predictive insights to tailor compensation for flight disruptions, differentiating between frequent fliers and occasional travelers. The resulting impact was a 210 percent improvement in targeting at-risk customers, an 800 percent rise in customer satisfaction, and a 59 percent reduction in churn among high-value travelers. That same type of intelligence is also proving useful to enhancing pricing. Agentic AI can sense market shifts, model outcomes, and act instantly by adjusting prices or reallocating inventory in real time based on competitor moves, customer behavior, or demand forecasts. Airlines, for instance, are already using agentic AI to create personalized bundles that combine fares, seating, and add-on offers, updating prices dynamically based on live signals such as search trends, weather, and booking patterns. 2. Think in terms of workflows, not agents Organizations realizing meaningful impact from agentic AI are going beyond simply deploying new agents to improve existing tasks; they are redesigning workflows . Agents enhance value creation when used to improve end-to-end processes and journeys through automation and coordination\u2014their power is limited, however, when used to improve isolated steps. Enhancing product discovery, for example, delivers limited impact if purchasing and fulfillment remain slow or disjointed. In traditional processes, work moves sequentially, often across departments: Marketing hands off to sales, service escalates to support, and pricing follows. Each of these functions has made Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 3 tremendous progress in recent years by incorporating digital and analytics capabilities, and agentic AI builds on those improvements by automating and orchestrating tasks across teams and functions. Overcoming the persistent challenges of coordination across complex operational silos and workflows can allow organizations to achieve faster cycle times, as well as greater consistency and responsiveness at a scale no level of human coordination could match. Crucially, success calls for designing processes around agents\u2014not bolting agents onto legacy processes. For example, rather than using agents to help customer service teams respond to complaints faster, leading organizations use agents to predict potential issues, trigger outreach before a customer calls, and resolve cases pre-emptively with personalized offers. The European insurer offers a clear view of what this looks like in practice. According to McKinsey analysis, in just 16 weeks, the company re-architected its commercial model around a connected network of agents working across the full customer journey. The improvements generated included the following: \u2014 Knowledge agents centralized over 1,000 policy and product documents, enabling frontline staff to retrieve accurate answers instantly. \u2014Coaching agents introduced AI-driven call transcription and grading, automatically reviewing 95 percent of sales calls versus 3 percent previously. \u2014Integration agents", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\agents-for-growth-turning-ai-promise-into-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 3, "title": "agents for growth turning ai promise into impact"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-agents-for-growth-turning-ai-promise-into-impact-1", "content": "impact 3 tremendous progress in recent years by incorporating digital and analytics capabilities, and agentic AI builds on those improvements by automating and orchestrating tasks across teams and functions.

Together, these agentic systems shortened average call times by 25 percent, reduced manual cross-functional handoffs, and created a continuous feedback loop. As agents learned from each engagement, they continually refined next-best actions, message sequencing, and product pairing to stay aligned with evolving customer needs. Value creation with AI agents for end-to-end change depends, however, on matching the right agent to the right task: domain-specific agents that handle complex, contextual actions; generalist agents for tasks such as data synthesis or content generation; agents that check for errors; and orchestration agents that direct and synchronize the system as a whole. Humans have a crucial role in this effort. They can work closely with agents to supervise and verify, as well as manage issues that AI agents escalate to them. The most advanced organizations combine these human\u2013agent collaborations into adaptive workflows that evolve with each iteration and customer signal. Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 4 3.Build collaborative agents, not just add-on tools To scale agentic AI, organizations need to stop thinking of agents as add-on tools and start treating them as collaborative, digital partners. That means defining the agents\u2019 roles, onboarding them properly, and managing them with clear performance expectations\u2014not unlike human team members. The right metrics for measuring AI agents\u2019 performance differ from traditional productivity KPIs, however. Rather than focusing on call counts or campaign volume, for example, leading organizations track a mix of indicators such as conversation quality, task-completion accuracy, escalation precision, and learning velocity, reflecting how effectively agents incorporate feedback and adapt to changing buyer cues. Because every agent action is logged and traceable, these metrics can be monitored continuously. Real-time dashboards surface performance drift, benchmark outcomes against human baselines, and flag when retraining or recalibration is needed. A leading US homebuilder demonstrates how this discipline translates into impact. Seeking to improve digital engagement and appointment conversion, the company trained AI sales agents to emulate its top-performing human sellers. McKinsey analysis of more than 500,000 sales transcripts revealed dozens of conversation states\u2014greeting, objection handling, follow-up, close\u2014and the patterns most associated with success. Using these insights, the team developed agent personas with unique styles, tempos, and conversational approaches. Every AI-led conversation was then benchmarked against human baselines using a scoring agent that evaluated accuracy, personalization, and flow. Dashboards highlighted drop-off points and tone mismatches, enabling rapid tuning. Conversion-to-appointment rates tripled, weekly appointments doubled, and the best-performing agents reached human-level parity in empathy and flow. 4.Build the agentic growth organization As agents take on workflows that cut across marketing, sales, and customer service, companies need to rethink how growth is organized. The traditional model where each function operates in its own silo is giving way to an integrated system where agents coordinate activities, share data, and connect the entire customer journey from awareness to loyalty. Campaign design, lead conversion, and customer engagement are no longer sequential steps but parts of a single, learning loop. This shift requires a new, hybrid human\u2013AI operating model. In this system, agents handle orchestration and execution, while humans provide strategy, creativity, and oversight. Growth teams become cross-functional by design, with marketers, sellers, customer service reps, and data scientists collaborating around shared workflows and common KPIs. Agents are reused across functions rather than duplicated: One agent that fetches customer data can support campaign planning, sales calls, or post-purchase service interactions. Agents for growth: Turning AI promise into impact 5 Without effective governance and an agentic architecture, however, this scale can lead to \u201cagent chaos\u201d through redundant builds, inconsistent quality, and unmanaged risk. To scale effectively, leading companies are standing up agent factories: dedicated hubs that industrialize how agents are built, deployed, and governed. These hubs standardize reusable blueprints, shared data products, and guardrails for security and compliance. And the standardized agents they build are assigned clear, role-based responsibilities, so that lead agents orchestrate work, practitioner agents execute tasks, and QA and compliance agents monitor performance. Several global banks exemplify this approach, standing up agent factories to transform their due-diligence processes. Each factory deploys agent squads to handle discrete steps, from data extraction to validation and quality assurance, reducing manual work while improving accuracy and control. A leading North American manufacturer of outdoor lifestyle products applied similar principles to customer service. According to McKinsey analysis, after analyzing more than 30,000 service tickets and call transcripts, the company redesigned the function so agents handle diagnosis, data retrieval, and summarization, while humans focus on empathy and resolution. Adoption succeeded through a tailored change-management program that included leaders being trained on KPI dashboards, frontline staff receiving job aids for AI-assisted workflows, and technical teams learning model maintenance and tuning. Continuous feedback loops and shared dashboards keep both human and digital agents aligned to drive faster resolution times, higher satisfaction, and measurable revenue uplift. As these systems mature, the differentiator becomes human capability. The role of people shifts from completing tasks to supervising, refining, and improving how the work gets done. Managers and specialists must learn to delegate to agents, review outputs, identify exceptions, and guide learning loops. Emerging skills\u2014such as prompt design, outcome tracking, and escalation management\u2014are fast becoming core to modern growth roles. Many organizations already target 25 to 50 percent of employees to work regularly with agentic AI\u2014a clear signal that fluency in collaborating with AI is becoming a defining business capability. One year into the agentic AI era, the lesson is clear: growth won\u2019t come from tools alone but from how leaders choose to build and deploy them. Competitive advantage will depend not on how many agents a company launches but on how effectively they are designed, managed, and scaled. The companies pulling ahead are already putting new mindsets into practice.

These are the leadership tests of the agentic era. Very soon the central question for leaders will move on from \u201cwhat can this agent do for us\u201d to \u201cwhat outcomes am I prepared to deliver with it, and how can I best use the space it creates to allow humans to do what only they can do even better?\u201d The sooner that organizations can embed agentic AI into their marketing, sales, and customer support operations, the sooner they will be able to answer those larger questions.

This article is a collaborative effort by Benjamin Klein, Charlie Lewis, and Rich Isenberg, with Dante Gabrielli, Helen M\u00f6llering, Raphael Engler, and Vincent Yuan, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Risk & Resilience Practice. October 2025 Business leaders are rushing to embrace agentic AI, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. Autonomous and goal driven, agentic AI systems are able to reason, plan, act, and adapt without human oversight\u2014powerful new capabilities that could help organizations capture the potential unleashed by gen AI by radically reinventing the way they operate. A growing number of organizations are now exploring or deploying agentic AI systems, which are projected to help unlock $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually in value across more than 60 gen AI use cases, including customer service, software development, supply chain optimization, and compliance. 1 And the journey to deploying agentic AI is only beginning: just 1 percent of surveyed organizations believe that their AI adoption has reached maturity. 2 But while agentic AI has the potential to deliver immense value, the technology also presents an array of new risks\u2014introducing vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations, compromise sensitive data, or erode customer trust. Not only do AI agents provide new external entry points for would-be attackers, but because they are able to make decisions without human oversight, they also introduce novel internal risks. In cybersecurity terms, you might think of AI agents as \u201cdigital insiders\u201d\u2014entities that operate within systems with varying levels of privilege and authority. Just like their human counterparts, these digital insiders can cause harm unintentionally, through poor alignment, or deliberately if they become compromised. Already, 80 percent of organizations say they have encountered risky behaviors from AI agents, including improper data exposure and access to systems without authorization. 3 It is up to technology leaders\u2014including chief information officers (CIOs), chief risk officers (CROs), chief information security officers (CISOs), and data protection officers (DPOs)\u2014to develop a thorough understanding of the emerging risks associated with AI agents and agentic workforces and to proactively ensure secure and compliant adoption of the technology. (A review of early agentic AI deployments highlights six key lessons \u2014from reimagining workflows to embedding observability\u2014that can help organizations avoid some common pitfalls as they scale the new technology. 4) The future of AI at work isn\u2019t just faster or smarter. It\u2019s more autonomous. Agents will increasingly initiate actions, collaborate across silos, and make decisions that affect business outcomes. That\u2019s an exciting development\u2014provided those agents are working with not just a company\u2019s access but also its intent. In an agentic world, trust is not a feature. It must be the foundation. Emerging risks in the agentic era By operating autonomously and automating tasks traditionally performed by human employees, agentic AI adds an additional dimension to the risk landscape. The key shift is a move from systems that enable interactions to systems that drive transactions that directly affect business processes and outcomes. This shift intensifies the challenges around core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the agentic context, due to the additional potential of amplifying foundational risks, such as data privacy, denial of services, and system integrity. The following new risk drivers transcend the traditional risk taxonomy associated with AI 5: 1 \u201cThe promise and the reality of gen AI agents in the enterprise ,\u201d McKinsey, May 17, 2024. 2 Hannah Mayer, Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, and Roger Roberts, \u201c Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI\u2019s full potential ,\u201d McKinsey, January 28, 2025. 3 AI agents: The new attack surface; A global survey of security, IT professionals and executives , SailPoint Technologies, May 28, 2025. 4 Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Stephen Xu, \u201c One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work ,\u201d McKinsey, September 12, 2025. 5 \u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety ,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly , March 13, 2024. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 2 \u2014 Chained vulnerabilities. A flaw in one agent cascades across tasks to other agents, amplifying the risks. Example: Due to a logic error, a credit data processing agent misclassifies short-term debt as income, inflating the applicant\u2019s financial profile. This incorrect output flows downstream to the credit scoring and loan approval agents, leading to an unjustified high score and risky loan approval. \u2014 Cross-agent task escalation. Malicious agents exploit trust mechanisms to gain unauthorized privileges. Example: A compromised scheduling agent in a healthcare system requests patient records from a clinical-data agent, falsely escalating the task as coming from a licensed physician. The agent then releases sensitive health data, resulting in unauthorized access and potential data leakage without triggering security alerts. \u2014 Synthetic-identity risk. Adversaries forge or impersonate agent identities to bypass trust mechanisms. Example: An attacker forges the digital identity of a claims processing agent and submits a synthetic request to access insurance claim histories. Trusting the spoofed agent\u2019s credentials, the system grants access, exposing sensitive policyholder data without detecting impersonation. \u2014 Untraceable data leakage. Autonomous agents exchanging data without oversight obscure leaks and evade audits. Example: An autonomous customer support agent shares transaction history with an external fraud detection agent to resolve a query but also includes unneeded personally identifiable information about the customer. Since the data exchange isn\u2019t logged or audited, the leakage of sensitive banking data goes unnoticed. \u2014 Data corruption propagation. Low-quality data silently affects decisions across agents. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 3Example: In the pharmaceutical industry, a data labeling agent incorrectly tags a batch of clinical-trial results. This flawed data is then used by efficacy analysis and regulatory reporting agents, leading to distorted trial outcomes and potentially unsafe drug approval decisions. Such errors threaten to erode faith in the business processes and decisions that agentic systems are designed to automate, undermining whatever efficiency gains they deliver. Fortunately, this is not inevitable. Agentic AI can deliver on its potential, but only if the principles of safety and security outlined below are woven into deployments from the outset. Guiding principles for agentic AI security To adopt agentic AI securely, organizations can take a structured, layered approach. Below, we provide a practical road map that outlines the key questions technology leaders should ask to assess readiness, mitigate risks, and promote confident adoption of agentic systems. The journey begins with updating risks and governance frameworks, moves to establish mechanisms for oversight and awareness, and concludes with implementing security controls. Prior to agentic deployment Before an organization begins using autonomous agents, it should ensure that it has the necessary safeguards, risk management practices, and governance in place for a secure, responsible, and effective adoption of the technology. Here are some key questions to consider: \u2014 Does our AI policy framework address agentic systems and their unique risks? Answering this question starts with upgrading existing AI policies, standards, and processes\u2014such as identity and access management (IAM) and third-party risk management (TPRM)\u2014to cover the new capabilities of agentic systems.

Prior to agentic deployment Before an organization begins using autonomous agents, it should ensure that it has the necessary safeguards, risk management practices, and governance in place for a secure, responsible, and effective adoption of the technology. Here are some key questions to consider: \u2014 Does our AI policy framework address agentic systems and their unique risks? Answering this question starts with upgrading existing AI policies, standards, and processes\u2014such as identity and access management (IAM) and third-party risk management (TPRM)\u2014to cover the new capabilities of agentic systems. For instance, in the context of IAM, organizations should define roles and approval processes for agents to protect interactions with data, systems, and human users. Similarly, they should define and review the interactions of agentic solutions acquired from third parties with internal resources. Organizations must also grapple with the ever-changing nature of AI regulations. They can start by identifying the rules they are subject to. Article 22 of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, restricts the usage of AI by granting individuals the right to deny decisions based solely on automated processing. In the United States, sector-specific laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) impose requirements on AI systems to prevent discrimination. Additionally, state-level initiatives, such as New York City\u2019s Local Law 144, mandate bias audits for automated employment decision tools, signaling a growing trend toward AI accountability. New AI-specific regulations, like the EU AI Act, are being adopted and will take full effect in the next three years. In this rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, in which many requirements remain unclear, a conservative approach\u2014anticipating likely standards, such as human oversight, data protection, and fairness\u2014can help organizations stay ahead and avoid costly compliance overhauls in the future. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 4 For each agentic use case in an organization\u2019s AI portfolio, tech leaders should identify and assess the corresponding organizational risks, and, if needed, update their risk assessment methodology. \u2014 Is our risk management program equipped to handle agentic AI risks? Enterprise cybersecurity frameworks\u2014such as ISO 27001, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), and SOC 2\u2014focus on systems, processes, and people. They do not yet fully account for autonomous agents that can act with discretion and adaptability. To bridge this gap, organizations can revise their risk taxonomy to explicitly account for the novel risks introduced by agentic AI (exhibit). For each agentic use case in an organization\u2019s AI portfolio, tech leaders should identify and assess the corresponding organizational risks, and, if needed, update their risk assessment methodology to be capable of measuring risks within agentic AI. Without this transparency, risks arising from agentic AI threaten to become a black box even more than what we\u2019ve seen with analytical or gen AI. \u2014Do we have robust governance for managing AI across its full life cycle? Establishing governance requires defining standardized oversight processes, including ownership and responsibilities within AI onboarding, deployment, and offboarding procedures; monitoring and anomaly detection tied to KPIs; defining triggers for escalations; and developing standards of accountability for agent actions. For each agentic AI solution in the portfolio, Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 5 organizations should start by listing technical details\u2014such as foundational model, hosting location, and data sources accessed\u2014as well as the criticality of the use case, contextual data sensitivity, access rights, and interagent dependencies. Next, they should establish clear ownership of each use case, with human-in-the-loop oversight and responsible stakeholders for decision-making, security, and compliance, while also identifying and allocating capabilities to manage the risks. Exhibit Prior to launching an agentic use case Once the above foundational questions have been addressed and an agentic AI risk framework and policies are in place, organizations should develop a clear understanding of precisely what they are building, accounting for associated risks and compliance considerations for each project. Addressing the following questions can help ensure that their ambitions are matched by readiness: Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 6 Especially in the experimental or piloting stage, AI projects have a way of proliferating rapidly without adequate oversight, which can make it challenging to manage risks or enforce governance. \u2014 How can we maintain control of agentic initiatives and ensure that we have oversight over all projects? Especially in the experimental or piloting stage, AI projects have a way of proliferating rapidly without adequate oversight, which can make it challenging to manage risks or enforce governance. Organizations should establish a clear, centrally steered, and business-aligned AI portfolio management system that ensures oversight by IT risk, information security, and IT compliance functions. This system should provide full transparency around business, IT, and security ownership; detailed descriptions of use cases; a list of the data provided to the agent for training, interaction (for example, connected APIs), or both; and the status of the data. The repository should also include all agentic systems that are currently in development, being piloted, or being planned by business units. This can help organizations avoid experimental and uncontrolled deployment of models with potentially unintended critical exposure points. \u2014Do we have the capabilities to support and secure our agentic AI systems? To help ensure the success of agentic AI pilots, organizations should assess their current level of skills, knowledge, and resources in relation to the agentic road map\u2014including AI security engineering, security testing, threat modeling, and the skills required for governance, compliance, and risk management. They should then identify the skill and resource gaps that exist between agentic ambitions and security capabilities and launch awareness and educational campaigns to narrow such gaps\u2014while defining critical roles based on the AI life cycle. For example, organizations lacking knowledge regarding AI threats will need to upskill security engineers on threat modeling of AI models and agents. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 7 During the deployment of an agentic AI use case Once use cases and pilots are up and running, organizations will need to ensure that the pilots are enforced by technical and procedural controls. These controls should be regularly reassessed to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as agentic systems are refined and scaled. Here are some key questions to consider : \u2014Are we prepared for agent-to-agent interactions, and are those connections secure?

They should then identify the skill and resource gaps that exist between agentic ambitions and security capabilities and launch awareness and educational campaigns to narrow such gaps\u2014while defining critical roles based on the AI life cycle. For example, organizations lacking knowledge regarding AI threats will need to upskill security engineers on threat modeling of AI models and agents. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 7 During the deployment of an agentic AI use case Once use cases and pilots are up and running, organizations will need to ensure that the pilots are enforced by technical and procedural controls. These controls should be regularly reassessed to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as agentic systems are refined and scaled. Here are some key questions to consider : \u2014Are we prepared for agent-to-agent interactions, and are those connections secure? AI agents interact with not only human users but also other AI agents. It is essential that organizations secure these agent-to-agent collaborations, especially as multiagent ecosystems grow. Protocols to manage agentic interactions, such as Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol, Cisco\u2019s Agent Connect Protocol, Google\u2019s Agent2Agent protocol, and IBM\u2019s Agent Communication Protocol, are under development but not yet fully mature. As tech leaders monitor protocol evolution, they should also ensure that interagent communications are authenticated, logged, and properly permissioned. Rather than wait for perfect standards, it\u2019s best to implement safeguards now and plan for upgrades as more secure protocols emerge. \u2014Do we have control over who can use agentic systems and whether they are using them appropriately? Access to models and resources needs to be monitored and secured. Identity and access management systems should apply not only to human users, but also to AI agents that interact with other agents, humans, data, and system resources. Organizations should define which users, human or AI, are authorized to access or interface with such resources and assets and under what conditions. They should also augment IAM with input/output guardrails to prevent agents from being misused, manipulated, or triggered into unsafe behavior through adversarial prompts or misaligned objectives. Additionally, organizations need to carefully manage the ways in which third-party agentic AI agents interact with internal resources to help ensure that they meet the same security, governance, and ethical requirements as internal systems. \u2014Can we trace agents\u2019 actions and understand and account for their behavior? Agentic systems should be created with traceability mechanisms in place from the outset.6 That means recording not only the agents\u2019 actions but also the prompts, decisions, internal state changes, intermediate reasoning, and outputs that led to these behaviors. Such systems are essential for auditability, root cause analysis, regulatory compliance, and postincident reviews. Organizations should establish regular performance reviews to evaluate whether agents remain aligned with their intended purpose. \u2014 Do we have a contingency plan if an agent fails or behaves unexpectedly? Even well-designed agents can fail, become corrupt, or be exploited. Before deployment, organizations should develop a contingency plan, with proper security measures in place, for every critical agent. That starts with simulating worst-case scenarios, such as agents that become unresponsive, deviate from the expected objective, are intentionally malicious, or escalate tasks without 6 Carlo Giovine, Roger Roberts, Mara Pometti, and Medha Bankhwal, \u201cBuilding AI trust: The key role of explainability ,\u201d McKinsey, November 26, 2024. Deploying agentic AI with safety and security: A playbook for technology leaders 8 authorization. Next, organizations should ensure that termination mechanisms and fallback solutions are available. Lastly, they should deploy agents in self-contained environments with clearly defined network and data access. This also allows for immediate isolation if needed. By identifying and implementing effective controls, organizations can proactively mitigate agentic AI risks rather than reactively responding to them. For instance, maintaining a consistent AI agent portfolio alongside robust AI logging enables the monitoring of data exchanges between agents, thereby mitigating the risk of untraceable data leakage. Additionally, deploying an AI contingency plan and sandbox environment, in conjunction with IAM and guardrails, can effectively isolate an AI agent that attempts unauthorized privilege escalation through cross-agent task escalation. Agentic security cannot be an afterthought The agentic workforce is inevitable. As more companies adopt AI agents, new challenges for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data and systems will arise. Currently, decision- makers face a pivotal moment to balance business enablement with a structured approach to risk management for agentic security; after all, no one wants to become the first agentic AI security disaster case study. CIOs, CROs, and CISOs should promptly engage in essential discussions with their business counterparts to gain transparency about the current state of agentic AI adoption in the organization and start building the essential guardrails. Acting thoroughly and with intention now will help ensure successful scaling in the future. Currently, agentic transactions remain digital, but the trajectory points toward an even more radical future, including embodied agents operating in the physical world. The implications for safety and security will become even more profound, making it all the more important to prepare a strong foundation today.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re learning about how to get it right. by Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, and Roger Roberts with Stephen Xu September 2025 A year into the agentic AI revolution, one lesson is clear: It takes hard work to do it well. An agentic enterprise transformation holds the promise of unmatched productivity. While some companies are enjoying early successes with such activities, many more are finding it challenging to see value from their investments. In some cases, they are even retrenching\u2014rehiring people where agents have failed. What is agentic AI? Agentic AI is a system based on gen AI foundation models that can act in the real world and execute multistep processes. AI agents can automate and perform complex tasks, often using natural language processing, that would normally require human effort (for more, see \u201c What is an AI agent? ,\u201d from our McKinsey Explainers series).These stumbles are a natural evolution of any new technology, and we\u2019ve seen this pattern before with other innovations. To understand the early lessons, we recently dug into more than 50 agentic AI builds we\u2019ve led at McKinsey, as well as dozens of others in the marketplace. We\u2019ve boiled down our analysis results to six lessons to help leaders successfully capture value from agentic AI (see sidebar \u201cWhat is agentic AI?\u201d). It\u2019s not about the agent; it\u2019s about the workflow Achieving business value with agentic AI requires changing workflows. Often, however, organizations focus too much on the agent or the agentic tool. This inevitably leads to great- looking agents that don\u2019t actually end up improving the overall workflow, resulting in underwhelming value. Agentic AI efforts that focus on fundamentally reimagining entire workflows\u2014that is, the steps that involve people, processes, and technology\u2014are more likely to deliver a positive outcome. Understanding how agents can help with each of these steps is the path to value. People will still be central to getting the work done, but now with different agents, tools, and automations to support them. One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 2 An important starting point in redesigning workflows is mapping processes and identifying key user pain points. This step is critical in designing agentic systems that reduce unnecessary work and allow agents and people to collaborate and accomplish business goals more efficiently and effectively. That collaboration can happen through learning loops and feedback mechanisms, creating a self-reinforcing system. The more frequently agents are used, the smarter and more aligned they become. Consider an alternative dispute resolution service provider that was working to modernize its contract review workflows. Legal reasoning in the company\u2019s domain was constantly evolving, with new case law, jurisdictional nuances, and policy interpretations, making it challenging to codify expertise. To account for natural variance, the team designed its agentic systems to learn within the workflow. Every user edit in the document editor, for example, was logged and categorized. This provided the engineers and data scientists with a rich stream of feedback, which they could then use to teach the agents, adjust prompt logic, and enrich the knowledge base. Over time, the agents could codify new expertise. Focusing on the workflow instead of the agent enabled teams to deploy the right technology at the right point, which is especially important when reengineering complex, multistep workflows (exhibit). For example, insurance companies often have big investigative workflows that span multiple steps (such as claims handling and underwriting), with each step requiring different types of activities and cognitive tasks. Companies can redesign these types of workflows by thoughtfully deploying a targeted mix of rule-based systems, analytical AI, gen AI, and agents, all underpinned by a common orchestration framework (such as open-source frameworks like AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph). In these cases, the agents are the orchestrators and the integrators, accessing tools and integrating outputs of other systems into their context. They are the glue that unifies the workflow so it delivers real closure with less intervention needed. Agents aren\u2019t always the answer AI agents can do a lot, but they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for everything. Too often, leaders don\u2019t look closely enough at the work that needs to be done or ask whether an agent would be the best choice to perform that work. To help avoid wasted investments or unwanted complexity, business leaders can approach the role of agents much like they do when evaluating people for a high-performing team. The key question to ask is, \u201cWhat is the work to be done and what are the relative talents of each potential team member\u2014or agent\u2014to work together to achieve those goals?\u201d Business problems can often be addressed with simpler automation approaches, such as rules-based automation, predictive analytics, or large language model (LLM) prompting, which can be more reliable than agents out of the box. Before rushing into an agentic solution, business leaders should take stock of the task\u2019s demands. In practice, that means getting clear on how standardized the process should be, how One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 3 Exhibit 1 much variance the process needs to handle, and what portions of the work agents are best suited to do. On one level, these issues are straightforward. For example, low-variance, high-standardization workflows, such as investor onboarding or regulatory disclosures, tend to be tightly governed and follow predictable logic. In these cases, agents based on nondeterministic LLMs could add more complexity and uncertainty than value. By contrast, high-variance, low-standardization workflows could benefit significantly from agents. For example, agents were deployed at a financial-services company to extract complex financial information, reducing the amount of human validation required and streamlining workflows. These tasks demanded information aggregation, verification checks, and compliance analysis\u2014tasks where agents can be effective. One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 4 High-level rules of thumb when considering what AI tools to use When deciding which AI tool to use for different tasks, the following guidelines can help: \u2014If the task is rule based and repetitive, with structured input (say, data entry), use rule-based automation. \u2014If the input is unstructured (for example, lengthy documents), but the task is still extractive or generative, use gen AI, natural language processing, or predictive analytics. \u2014If the task involves classification or forecasting from past data, use predictive analytics or gen AI. \u2014If the output requires synthesis, judgment, or creative interpretation, use gen AI. \u2014If the task involves multistep decision-making and has a long tail of highly variable inputs and contexts, use AI agents.The important thing to remember is not to get trapped in a binary \u201cagent/no agent\u201d mindset. Some agents can do specific tasks well, others can help people do their work better, and in many cases, different technologies altogether might be more appropriate. The key is to figure out which tool or agent is best suited to the task, how people can work with them most effectively, and how agents and workers should be combined to deliver the greatest output. How well people, agents, and tools work together is the secret sauce for value (see sidebar \u201cHigh-level rules of thumb", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\one-year-of-agentic-ai-six-lessons-from-the-people-doing-the-work_vf.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 3, "title": "one year of agentic ai six lessons from the people doing the work_vf"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-one-year-of-agentic-ai-six-lessons-from-the-people-doing-the-work_vf-1", "content": "tool to use for different tasks, the following guidelines can help: \u2014If the task is rule based and repetitive, with structured input (say, data entry), use rule-based automation. \u2014If the input is unstructured (for example, lengthy documents), but the task is still extractive or generative, use gen AI, natural language processing, or predictive analytics. \u2014If the task involves classification or forecasting from past data, use predictive analytics or gen AI. \u2014If the output requires synthesis, judgment, or creative interpretation, use gen AI. \u2014If the task involves multistep decision-making and has a long tail of highly variable inputs and contexts, use AI agents.The important thing to remember is not to get trapped in a binary \u201cagent/no agent\u201d mindset.

How well people, agents, and tools work together is the secret sauce for value (see sidebar \u201cHigh-level rules of thumb when considering what AI tools to use\u201d). Stop \u2018AI slop\u2019: Invest in evaluations and build trust with users One of the most common pitfalls teams encounter when deploying AI agents is agentic systems that seem impressive in demos but frustrate users who are actually responsible for the work. It\u2019s common to hear users complain about \u201cAI slop\u201d or low-quality outputs. Users quickly lose trust in the agents, and adoption levels are poor. Any efficiency gains achieved through automation can easily be offset by a loss in trust or a decline in quality. A hard-won lesson of this recurring problem is that companies should invest heavily in agent development, just like they do for employee development. As one business leader told us, \u201cOnboarding agents is more like hiring a new employee versus deploying software.\u201d Agents should be given clear job descriptions, onboarded, and given continual feedback so they become more effective and improve regularly. One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 5 Developing effective agents is challenging work that requires harnessing individual expertise to create evaluations (or \u201cevals\u201d) and codifying best practices with sufficient granularity for given tasks. This codification serves as both the training manual and performance test for the agent, ensuring that it performs as expected. These practices may exist in standard operating procedures or as tacit knowledge in people\u2019s heads. When codifying practices, it\u2019s important to focus on what separates top performers from the rest. For sales reps, this might include how they drive the conversation, handle objections, and match the customer\u2019s style (see sidebar \u201cEval types\u201d). Eval types These are some typical evaluations used to assess agent performance: \u2014 Task success rate (end to end). The task success rate measures the percentage of workflows completed correctly without escalation or human intervention, reflecting real-world utility. \u2014 F1 score/precision and recall. This metric balances false positives and false negatives, making it useful for classification, extraction, and decision accuracy tasks where there is a clear measurable outcome (that is, yes or no). \u2014Retrieval accuracy. Retrieval accuracy is the percentage of correct documents, facts, or evidence retrieved relative to the ground truth set, which is critical for retrieval-augmented workflows. \u2014Semantic similarity. Semantic similarity is measured using embedding-based cosine similarity between generated output and reference output, capturing meaning alignment beyond exact word matching. \u2014LLM as judge. Using a large language model (LLM) as a judge involves evaluating outputs against gold standards or human preferences. This metric scales well for subjective judgments such as clarity, helpfulness, and reasoning soundness. \u2014Bias detection (via confusion matrices). Bias detection measures systematic differences in outcomes across user groups using confusion matrices, which highlight where bias manifests (for example, false negatives disproportionately affecting one group). \u2014Hallucination rate. This metric tracks the frequency of factually incorrect or unsupported claims, ensuring the trustworthiness of agent outputs. \u2014Calibration error (confidence versus accuracy). Calibration error measures whether the agent\u2019s confidence scores align with actual correctness, which is important for risk-sensitive workflows. One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 6 Crucially, experts should stay involved to test agents\u2019 performance over time; there can be no \u201claunch and leave\u201d in this arena. This commitment to evaluation requires, for example, experts to literally write down or label desired (and perhaps undesired) outputs for given inputs, which can sometimes number in the thousands for more complex agents. In this way, teams can evaluate how much an agent got right or wrong and make the necessary corrections. A global bank took this approach to heart when transforming its know-your-customer and credit-risk-analysis processes. Whenever the agent\u2019s recommendation on compliance with intake guidelines differed from human judgment, the team identified the logic gaps, refined the decision criteria, and reran tests. In one case, for example, the agents\u2019 initial analysis was too general. The team provided that feedback, then developed and deployed additional agents to ensure that the depth of analysis provided useful insights at the right level of granularity. One way they did this was by asking the agents \u201cwhy\u201d in multiple succession. This approach ensured the agents performed well, making it much more likely for people to accept their outputs. Make it easy to track and verify every step When working with only a few AI agents, reviewing their work and spotting errors can be mostly straightforward. But as companies roll out hundreds, or even thousands, of agents, the task becomes challenging. Exacerbating the issue is that many companies track only outcomes. So when there\u2019s a mistake\u2014and there will always be mistakes as companies scale agents\u2014it\u2019s hard to figure out precisely what went wrong. Agent performance should be verified at each step of the workflow. Building monitoring and evaluation into the workflow can enable teams to catch mistakes early, refine the logic, and continually improve performance, even after the agents are deployed. In one document review workflow, for instance, an alternative dispute resolution service provider\u2019s product team observed a sudden drop in accuracy when the system encountered a new set of cases. But since they\u2019d built the agentic workflow with observability tools to track every step of the process, the team quickly identified the issue: Certain user segments were submitting lower-quality data, leading to incorrect interpretations and poor downstream recommendations. With that insight, the team improved its data collection practices, provided document formatting guidelines to upstream stakeholders, and adjusted the system\u2019s parsing logic. Agent performance quickly rebounded. The best use case is the reuse case In the rush to make progress with agentic AI, companies often create a unique agent for each identified task. This can lead to significant redundancy and waste because the same agent can One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 7 often accomplish different tasks that share many of the same actions (such as ingesting, extracting, searching, and analyzing).

Deciding how much to invest in building reusable agents (versus an agent that executes one specific task) is analogous to the classic IT architecture problem where companies need to build fast but not lock in choices that constrain future capabilities. How to strike that balance often requires a lot of judgment and analysis. Identifying recurring tasks is a good starting point. Companies can develop agents and agent components that can easily be reused across different workflows, and make it simple for developers to access them. That includes developing a centralized set of validated services (such as LLM observability or preapproved prompts) and assets (for example, application patterns, reusable code, and training materials) that are easy to locate and use. Integrating these capabilities into a single platform is critical. In our experience, this helps to virtually eliminate 30 to 50 percent of the nonessential work typically required. Humans remain essential, but their roles and numbers will change As AI agents continue to proliferate, the question of what role humans will play has generated much anxiety\u2014about job security, on the one hand, and about high expectations for productivity increases, on the other. This has led to wildly diverging views on the role of humans in many present-day jobs. To be clear: Agents will be able to accomplish a lot, but humans will remain an essential part of the workforce equation even as the type of work that both agents and humans do changes over time. People will need to oversee model accuracy, ensure compliance, use judgment, and handle edge cases, for example. And as we discussed earlier, agents will not always be the best answer, so people working with other tools such as machine learning models will be needed. The number of people working in a particular workflow, however, will likely change and often will be lower once the workflow is transformed using agents. Business leaders will crucially have to manage these transitions as they would for any change program and thoughtfully allocate the work necessary to train and evaluate agents. Another big lesson from our experience is that companies should be deliberate in redesigning work so that people and agents can collaborate well together. Without that focus, even the most advanced agentic programs risk silent failures, compounding errors, and user rejection. Take the example of the alternative dispute resolution service provider mentioned earlier that wanted to use agents for a legal-analysis workflow. In designing the workflow, the team took the time to identify where, when, and how to integrate human input. In one case, agents were able to organize core claims and dollar amounts with high levels of accuracy, but it was important for lawyers to double-check and approve them, given how central the claims were to the entire case. One year of agentic AI: Six lessons from the people doing the work 8 Similarly, agents were able to recommend workplan approaches to a case, but given the importance of the decision, it was critical for people to not just review but also adjust the recommendation. The agents were also programmed to highlight edge cases and anomalies, helping lawyers develop more comprehensive views. Someone still had to sign the document at the end of the process, underwriting the legal decision with the person\u2019s license and credentials. An important part of this human\u2013agent collaborative design is developing simple visual user interfaces that make it easy for people to interact with agents. For example, one property and casualty insurance company developed interactive visual elements (such as bounding boxes, highlights, and automated scrolling) to help reviewers quickly validate AI-generated summaries. When people clicked on an insight, for example, the application would scroll directly to the correct page and highlight the appropriate text. This focus on the user experience saved time, reduced second-guessing, and built confidence in the system, leading to user acceptance levels near 95 percent. The world of AI agents is moving quickly, so we can expect to learn many more lessons. But unless companies approach their agentic programs with learning in mind (and in practice), they\u2019re likely to repeat mistakes and slow their progress.

This article is a collaborative effort by Dan Tinkoff, Delphine Zurkiya, Eoin Leydon, and Jeffrey Lewis, with Chaitanya Adabala Viswa, Lionel Jin, and Meredith Langstaff, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Life Sciences Practice and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. Life sciences companies are facing margin pressures, higher R&D costs, and the need for continuous innovation amid increasing technological and operational complexity. They\u2019re also struggling to attract and retain talent. Externally, they are subject to heavy regulatory oversight and legislative uncertainty. For pharmaceutical companies, many blockbuster drugs are nearing patent expiration. For medtech companies, many devices in development, such as robotics and connected devices, are becoming complex platforms. For life science services companies, AI and the shift to cell and gene therapies are driving rapid technological changes. Factors such as global economic shifts, trade tariffs, most-favored-nation pricing policies, supply chain vulnerabilities, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the landscape. Meanwhile, the rapid progress of AI creates both opportunities and challenges. These combined pressures make it essential for life sciences companies to find new ways to boost growth, improve productivity, and increase operational agility. Recent McKinsey research has found that nearly eight in ten companies use gen AI, yet 80 percent of them report no tangible bottom-line benefits.1 Function- specific AI use cases have the greatest potential benefits, but companies face hurdles in expanding them past the pilot stage.2 Think of it as the AI paradox\u2014the technology has potential, but enterprises haven\u2019t yet adopted it nor seen its benefits at scale. AI agents (for a definition, see sidebar \u201cWhat is agentic AI?\u201d) have the potential to resolve this paradox by changing AI\u2019s role from tool to coworker. They can be combined into configurable networks that help employees by collaborating with them, performing tasks on their behalf, and handling activities that are currently low priority because of limited capacity, such as those related to the large volumes of lower-priority customers, contracts, and invoices. In our experience, there are benefits to viewing AI as a coworker: People tend to be more patient with AI and invest their time to improve it through feedback; they become creative in finding more parts of their workflow that can be \u201cagentified\u201d once they see what is possible; and they proactively seek better ways to reorganize workflows once they understand how AI can help. To understand how agents might change work and responsibilities in life sciences, we conducted a thorough, end-to-end, task-based analysis to evaluate the potential benefits of AI agents in specific workflows (see sidebar \u201cHow we determined the potential benefits of agentic AI in life sciences\u201d). We analyzed 270 workflows and 1,200 tasks in 180 job families and found that agentic AI will transform workflows, change how work is done, and increase value by spurring growth and reducing costs in both pharma and medtech (Exhibit 1, parts 1 and 2). In pharma, 75 to 85 percent of workflows contain tasks that could be enhanced or automated by agents, potentially freeing up 25 to 40 percent of an organization\u2019s capacity. In medtech, the figure is 70 to 80 percent. These capacities are at the task level, so they may be fractions of employees\u2019 time. Organizations will need to make choices about how to redeploy this capacity, with implications for the shape of the organization and how work is conducted. Patients stand to benefit in various ways, including through quicker access to a wider range of new medicines, more personalized treatments developed using patient data, and improved matching of existing treatments to unmet needs. We estimate that the full potential of agents could give companies incremental growth of five to 13 percentage points in pharma and three to seven percentage points in medtech. EBITDA would increase by 3.4 to 5.4 percentage points in pharma and 2.2 to 4.7 percentage points in medtech over the next three to five years, in addition to current initiatives focused on growth and margin expansion. We found that the opportunities for agentic AI in the pharmaceutical and medtech sectors are similar in most domains, except in R&D, where their approaches differ significantly.

As man - agers transition to overseeing a flexible network of agents that perform, adapt, and learn, the operations of life sciences organizations could transform fundamen - tally. Because the life sciences industry is strictly regulated, agents must consult hu - mans before making important decisions or performing major tasks. Guardrails are set by the enterprise, a function or busi - ness unit, or the manager or supervisor overseeing that AI. 3 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI 1. We analyzed each domain in biopharmaceutical and medical technology firms and deconstructed their workflows to generate a comprehensive map of all 270 workflows. 2. For each workflow, we examined more than 1,200 key tasks to assess whether they could be agentified, with simpler or more complex agents; the share of the task that agents could handle; and the time they could save. 3. We examined the roles responsible for those tasks and the amount of time each role spends on them. We analyzed 180 job families and identified ten new roles, such as agent orchestrator and AI quality manager, that will be needed to support agents. 4. This provided us with a bottom-up view of growth and productivity opportunities, which we analyzed at the profit and loss (P&L) level for How we determined the potential benefits of agentic AI in life sciences each domain. A panel of technology and domain experts reviewed the benefits of each revenue and expense item and considered the costs to deploy and manage those agents. 5. We compiled those numbers by domain and functional area to assess the overall benefits to the P&L and the reduction in time-to-market for new medicines.Exhibit 1, part 2 Growth impact Expanded and better assets, more eligible patients reached, and revenue pulled forward within 3-to-5 year time frame, with potential for incremental 1% to 3% CAGR above baseline growthRoles with AI sidekicks With agents as integrated teammates, employees\u2019 impact for patients can be ampli/f_iedWeb <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <1B> of <9> Work will transform Note: Numbers do not include physical AI or growth from AI in products. 1Percentage pointsThere are several potential bene/f_its of AI agents in medtech.

Agentic AI can transform eight out of ten workflows . Of the more than 270 life sciences workflows we analyzed, 75 to 85 percent of workflows in pharma and medtech have tasks that could be automated or augmented by agents (Exhibit 2). Nearly 40 percent of workflows are relatively standard and predictable and could be addressed by lower-complexity agents that business users could customize and implement themselves, possibly with minimal technical support. Another 50 percent are more complex, domain-specific workflows that companies could support with custom-built agents to help them differentiate from competitors. 2. Up to 95 percent of life science roles may have agentic teammates . Every functional area, domain, and job family has tasks for which agents could be deployed. Two-thirds of those roles will be involved in some combination of directly building, managing, and supervising lower-complexity agents, which they will orchestrate, tune, monitor, and maintain. New team roles, such as agent orchestrators, AI governance and agent quality managers, and agent supervisors, could also be needed to implement and support agentic workers. We expect this shift to free up 25 to 40 percent of enterprise capacity, allowing employees to focus on more strategic, value- adding, and productive work (Exhibit 3). At first, this additional capacity will free up employees for part of their work week, but we anticipate that over time, job descriptions, job families, and even organizational charts will evolve to replace certain roles entirely. This creates an opportunity for the leadership team\u2014and especially human- resource officers\u2014to rethink the shape of the organization. Management will have to decide what to do with freed-up capacity; this will likely depend on the domain. Some companies will reinvest it, some will grow into it\u2014for example by freezing hiring\u2014and some might take the margin improvement. The greatest productivity boost may come from agents performing tasks that humans are not currently doing; we found that 40 percent of workflows include tasks that are too complex or uneconomical for humans to perform, but that agents could handle at scale. Agents could find patterns that humans cannot, especially in complex, unstructured datasets. This could help researchers gather insights from diverse sets of scientific data and identify value leakage in the long tail of invoices, which are typically not a priority for human review. Agents could also collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources to continually monitor and report on a company\u2019s brand health, enabling always-on brand performance. These agent-specific strengths can create possibilities for new workflows, processes, and ways of working.3 3. AI agents could boost growth and EBITDA . They could lift growth by 5.0 to 13.0 percentage points in pharma and 3.0 to 7.0 percentage points in medtech, while increasing the EBITDA of pharmaceutical companies by 3.4 to 5.4 percentage points and medtech companies by 2.2 to 4.7 percentage points over the next three to five years (Exhibit 4, parts 1 and 2).

Half of this increase would come from a boost in net revenue from acquiring more and better assets, reaching more eligible patients, and accelerating the time to market. The other half would come from greater efficiency in R&D and manufacturing and administration. As life sciences companies face margin pressures from portfolio crowding, policy changes, and pricing dynamics,4 this potential margin boost is especially important. Capturing the full potential of agentic AI requires an enterprise- wide effort to which every domain contributes. This may be challenging for some companies, but even a subset of domains transformed by agents would yield significant benefits. 3 \u201cThe future of work is agentic,\u201d McKinsey, June 3, 2025. 4 \u201cSimplification for success: Rewiring the biopharma operating model,\u201d McKinsey, March 21, 2025. 5 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI Exhibit 2 Domain % of work/f_lows R&D, regulatory, and quality Commercial Medical a\ufb00airs Operations IT HR Finance Medtech totalDomain % of work/f_lows Research and early development Development, regulatory, and quality Sales Market access Marketing Medical a\ufb00airs Operations IT HR Finance Pharma totalLower-complexity agents Higher-complexity agents Human-led or not for agents Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.Web <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <2> of <9> Proportion of existing pharma work/f_lows where agents could be deployedProportion of existing medtech work/f_lows where agents could be deployedAgents can augment 75 to 85 percent of today\u2019s work/f_lows.

Here are six life sciences battlegrounds where agent-based AI can generate substantial benefits: 1. Pharma research: Accelerating discovery and deepening scientific insight Research and early drug discovery involve complex processes, but agents can still enhance almost every workflow (Exhibit 5). The specialized data and expertise needed mean that nearly 60 percent of workflows will require custom-built agents. Once implemented, these agents can free up 21 to 30 percent of capacity in areas such as wet labs, data analytics, and regulatory support, which can be redirected to expand the research pipeline or accelerate the progression of candidate drugs to trials. With agentic AI, work for early-stage drug discovery and scientific exploration can be reimagined in the following ways: Autonomous data analysis and insight generation : An analytic agent can assist scientists by automatically preparing detailed data analyses of experimental data aggregated by a curator agent. The analytic agent would perform statistical analysis and visualizations, which are currently time- intensive tasks that require the expertise of highly trained scientific staff. The analytic agent can then work with a protocol-drafting agent, which suggests updates to the experiment protocols based on the Exhibit 3 16/endash.case22 20/endash.case30 R&D Customer service Commercial sales Medical a\ufb00airs Operations HR Finance Tech delivery 23/endash.case30 23/endash.case38 17/endash.case27 40/endash.case55 20/endash.case35 50/endash.case65Web <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <3> of <9> Proportion of pharma employee workloads that agents could free up R&D, regulatory, and qualityDomain % of workloads Domain % of workloads Commercial Medical a\ufb00airs Operations General and administrative (G&A)R&D and regulatory Commercial Medical a\ufb00airs Operations G&AProportion of medtech employee workloads that agents could free upAgents could free up 25 to 40 percent of employees\u2019 workloads.

The human scientist reviews and adjusts these suggestions, enabling faster iteration and improved experiment design. Data-driven drug-candidate selection : A key function of the drug discovery team is to evaluate drug candidates for a specific target. Traditionally, these decisions relied heavily on early preclinical efficacy experiments and expert opinions. With AI agents, the team can benefit from a much richer set of inputs. AI agents can synthesize insights from the latest literature and trial data compiled by a literature-explorer agent, perform in silico modeling of success probabilities using real-world data, multiomic analyses from the data-science agent, and endpoint simulations from the feature-generation agent, creating a prioritized list of potential drug candidates. With the help of these agents, the team can efficiently review and approve this list for the next stage of screening and testing, significantly improving and hastening the decision process. Accelerated regulatory submission preparation : A regulatory-drafting agent could autonomously compile the latest efficacy and toxicology testing data into a submission-ready document. What once took a week or two of manual effort now only requires the scientist a few hours to review and finalize. By automating the drafting process, the regulatory-drafting agent not only reduces timelines but also ensures compliance with 9 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI Exhibit 5 Series 2 Series 1 Series 2 Series 3Web <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <6> of <9> Predominantly lower-complexityMix of lower- and higher-complexityPredominantly higher-complexityMainly human-led or not for agentsRelative value at stake by work/f_low, with type of agent 1Mechanisms of action.Most work/f_lows in research and early development can bene/f_it from agents.

Several large pharmaceutical companies are actively leveraging AI, including agentic AI, to speed up various stages of drug discovery and development. One has a collaboration with a company that integrates AI and robotics for drug discovery. It uses AI-powered platforms for molecular modeling, crystal structure prediction, and screening to identify and improve small-molecule drugs. The AI autonomously performs complex calculations and predictions to reduce the list of potential drug candidates and optimize workflows. 2. Pharma development: Accelerating clinical trials and enhancing patient journeys Agentic AI can help companies conduct clinical trials faster, more efficiently, and with higher quality while also improving the patient experience. Although study teams have already been working toward these goals using digital tools, AI, and gen AI, we expect a major shift to come about once agents are more fully implemented. Agents are no longer just tools for study teams; they are evolving into intelligent partners that collaborate with teams throughout the clinical trial process and can operate semiautonomously to handle a wide range of workflows. Over the next five years, we expect this to lead to a 35 to 45 percent boost in productivity in clinical development that will benefit every function (Exhibit 6). Agents can also shorten timelines, delivering medicines to patients more quickly and accelerating revenues, and enhance decision-making and execution, thereby increasing the likelihood of demonstrating the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. We see agents performing seven key roles in development: 1. optimizing trial designs informed by agentic retrieval of benchmarks and data, with scenarios designed using machine learning (ML) 2. orchestrating sites, vendors, and sponsors for site start-ups Exhibit 6 Incremental time spent on agents Time savings from agentsWeb <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <7> of <9> Work hours shifted by agentic workforce, % of function capacity FunctionAgents can bene/f_it roles in every clinical development function.

Study start-up: A site feasibility agent creates site questionnaires based on the trial protocol and compiles the responses. The start-up selection agent then uses ML -based site selection to produce a prioritized site list of predicted high-performing sites for the study start-up team to review and confirm. A site contracting agent then automatically drafts \u201cfirst time right\u201d site contracts based on fair market value benchmarks, site potential, and site-specific precedents, speeding up contracting processes. The process then moves to the document drafting agent, which automatically drafts site-specific documents such as the investigator brochure and site initiation visit materials, enabling the start-up team to quickly activate the sites. This agentic approach could double site activation rates with 30 to 50 percent fewer staff. Clinical data flow : At the beginning of trials, the case report form (CRF) design agent extracts structured protocol metadata to create annotated CRFs, which are then provided to the electronic data capture configuration agent to support quicker database setup. During the trial, the data entry agent flags delays in data entry and involves clinical research associates to ensure CRFs are completed. Meanwhile, the query generation agent detects anomalies in the data and automatically raises relevant queries. These queries are handled by a data cleaning agent, which flags complex queries for human review. Once the database is locked, the programming agent produces analysis datasets and results tables from the collated data, with a human biostatistician providing input for nonroutine datasets. This process could boost productivity in data management and programming by 60 percent, while reducing database build timelines from two to three months to under two weeks. One major pharmaceutical company has adopted a multi-agent trial copilot to improve its oversight of the development process. The clinical operations team works with a supervisor agent that manages a group of specialized agents focused on site activation, subject enrollment, data management, and analyzing longitudinal trends. These agents use data from the company\u2019s clinical control tower, including portfolio, trial, and site information, to provide real-time, actionable insights and initiate proactive interventions to support on-time trial completion. The company plans to give its agent teams more independence in the future, including engaging principal investigators and clinical research associates for routine tasks. 3. Medtech research and development: Accelerating innovation and prototyping By automating complex tasks such as prototyping, design controls, patent filing, and risk management, agents could free up 15 to 20 percent of capacity for R&D teams, allowing them to focus on higher- value activities, including strategic innovation, partnerships, and designs centered around patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). This 12 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI acceleration would shorten the time to market for life-saving medical devices. Also, improved decision- making and risk mitigation could lead to safer, more effective devices that better meet patient needs, boosting clinical and commercial success. Agents could support medtech R&D teams in a variety of ways: Prototyping and design controls : Prototyping is essential in medtech R&D, where engineers improve device designs and manufacturing to meet requirements. Agents could transform this process and assist teams by autonomously creating and testing virtual prototypes. A design- simulation agent could analyze specifications, simulate performance, identify flaws, and suggest improvements early. A compliance agent could compare prototypes to standards and flag noncompliance in real time. Innovation mapping and patent filing : In the medtech sector, it is crucial to stay at the forefront of innovation. Agents can transform how R&D teams identify opportunities and safeguard intellectual property. An innovation-mapping agent could scan defined sources of patents, industry literature such as journals, and trade publications to discover emerging technologies and trends, then compare these to existing products and solutions to identify unmet needs and opportunities for research. This agent could generate a prioritized list of opportunities along with competitive analyses, which could be designed and prototyped with agentic assistance. Once a concept is developed, a patent-drafting agent could prepare the initial submission, ensuring legal and technical compliance. Automating these tasks would help R&D teams find high-value opportunities more quickly and better secure their IP. Design controls and regulatory readiness : Once a design has been finalized, a documentation agent could generate design-control files based on specifications, reducing design time. Risk management is vital in medtech R&D to ensure device safety and efficacy. Agents could streamline this by automatically identifying, assessing, and suggesting mitigations for risks throughout the product life cycle. A risk-assessment agent could analyze design inputs, manufacturing, and post- market data to create a risk profile. A risk mitigation agent could recommend design or process changes using predictive modeling. And for regulatory readiness, a submission agent could compile the necessary documents, reducing risk-management efforts by 15 percent. As an example, a leading medtech company is already leveraging agentic AI to transform its product and software development processes. The company has implemented a multi-agent By automating certain complex tasks such as prototyping, agents could free up 15 to 20 percent of capacity for R&D teams. 13 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI system to tackle key challenges such as managing interdependencies between systems and teams, tracking delivery, and consistently maintaining quality in more complex products and devices. Specialized agents now oversee critical tasks, including software testing, design iteration, and risk mitigation, while a central AI supervisor with human oversight coordinates these efforts to ensure smooth integration among teams and systems. By automating routine tasks and providing real-time insights, the company has greatly enhanced its ability to manage complexity and deliver high- quality products on schedule. 4.

Commercial pharma and medtech: Elevating customer engagement and market success Commercial organizations in both pharma and medtech are grappling with rising complexity in engagement, increasing demands for personalization from HCPs and patients, an evolving policy environment, and cost constraints. Internal processes from brand planning to field enablement remain fragmented and inefficient, burdened by manual workflows and legacy systems. In pharma, companies\u2019 growing dependence on a sprawling network of external vendors is making cost structures unsustainable. Agentic AI can help by taking on time-consuming activities like drafting brand plans or preparing contracts, freeing up teams to focus on strategic execution. They can also unlock new capabilities that were previously out of reach, including real- time insights for decision-making; self-service content creation; automated first-pass medical, legal, and regulatory reviews; and personalized pre-call planning for field representatives. These initiatives could translate into a 4 to 8 percent increase in revenues and a 5 to 9 percent reduction in commercial spending over the next five years. Here are three transformations that can be enabled by agentic AI in commercial: Sales engagement : Agentic AI can transform sales operations in life sciences. Intelligent assistants can redefine account representative engagement by supporting pre- and postcall activities, such as HCP and territory planning, capturing insights from individual interactions, automating follow-up tasks, and providing personalized coaching feedback to reps. These tools can help identify trends early and enable personalized, data-driven engagement by synthesizing clinical evidence, product info, and engagement data in a conversational format. Virtual sales platforms can extend reach to hard-to- access territories and HCPs in a compliant, scalable way, adding value to the HCP experience. These innovations could reduce the burdens of sales representatives by 15 to 25 percent and increase revenue by up to 3 percent through improved targeting and stronger relationships. Marketing : Agentic AI is revolutionizing marketing workflows in strategic planning, content creation, review, campaign development and execution, and performance tracking. Self-serve platforms let marketers produce content independently, reducing their reliance on agencies and speeding up turnaround times. Automated pre-MLR (medical, legal, and regulatory) review systems identify common issues before formal review, decreasing cycle times and improving compliance. Unified platforms that aggregate internal and external data, with conversational interfaces, help marketers understand brand performance and patient and HCP needs. These tools automate tasks, speed execution, and provide intelligence to enhance responsiveness to changes in the market. Market access and payer engagement : Agentic AI can enhance market access and payer engagement through increased automation, better decision- making, and minimized value leakage. Advanced gross-to-net optimization can simulate complex access scenarios at brand and portfolio levels, helping to inform trade-offs that were once difficult to make. A contracting-intelligence platform can enable smarter contract decisions by analyzing past deals, modeling potential outcomes, and guiding negotiation strategies. Several manual tasks can also be automated, including creating initial contract drafts, monitoring performance, and tracking compliance. Automated invoice auditing can ensure contract terms are upheld and identify discrepancies early. Together, these innovations can reduce manual workload, boost financial results, and support more strategic, data-driven decisions while fostering more consistent and effective engagement with payers. 14 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI 5. Pharma and medtech operations: Accelerating execution and decision making Life sciences operations face many challenges, including high interdependence between subfunctions and the need for time-critical decision-making and extensive quality and compliance documentation. These issues can be addressed with tailored agents or groups of agents, which can speed up processes and boost efficiency by improving metrics like service levels, forecast accuracy, manufacturing throughput, deviation rate, and cycle time for document creation. Agent-based AI could help with 75 to 85 percent of workflows in operations, reducing the time required for key tasks in supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, product development (CMC), and quality by 25 to 35 percent (Exhibit 7). Here are three ways in which agentic AI can improve operations: Solving interdependencies with cross-operations planning : Integrated end-to-end operations planning\u2014which is essential to optimizing production and ensuring product availability\u2014requires alignment among enterprise functions. Orchestrating agents can enable multifunctional interactions, eliminating delays from inefficient communication and approval processes. Agents can connect components such as supply planning, raw material supply, and manufacturing by reacting to external factors such as demand fluctuations. This integration transcends Exhibit 7 Incremental time spent on agents Time savings from agentsWeb <2025> <MCK254200 Agentic AI> Exhibit <7> of <9> Work hours shifted by agentic workforce, % of function capacity FunctionAgents can shift workforce hours across operations functions.

For example, a supply chain planning agent can ingest demand signals to simulate scenarios and create forecasts, which a production planning agent can then use to schedule batches. A raw materials agent can monitor inventory levels to trigger reorders, ensuring the availability of raw materials. Automating decision-making : Agentic AI tools can improve decision-making and accelerate processes in all operations. To improve decision-making, multicomponent platform servers can be set up as middleware that allows agents to access data in a structured way, providing better contextual awareness of multistep tasks. Agents help identify changes in signals to process inputs and execute optimization decisions. For example, in plant operations, by directly connecting to manufacturing execution and process-information systems, agents can detect and respond to deviations in real time. They can increase yield and product quality by adjusting bioreactor parameters such as pH and O2 and modifying machine settings like pressure, temperature, and linear motor speed for fully automated medtech manufacturing lines. Procurement category management agents can track changes in raw material supply and commodity prices to initiate targeted negotiations. Negotiation agents can coach procurement managers to negotiate with suppliers. Supplier management agents can observe suppliers\u2019 performance metrics and detect negative trends, such as in service levels, before they significantly affect operations. Accelerating document generation : Operations teams spend a lot of time manually drafting good manufacturing practice documents for on-site and above-site workflows. Two types of documentation agents can help ease this burden. The first type creates templates for standardized documents by using historical reports and good documentation practices requirements to draft initial versions of standard operating procedures, deviation and corrective and preventive action reports, validation protocols and reports, change control impact assessments, and technology", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\reimagining-life-science-enterprises-with-agentic-ai.pdf", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 8, "title": "reimagining life science enterprises with agentic ai"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-reimagining-life-science-enterprises-with-agentic-ai-6", "content": "better contextual awareness of multistep tasks.

The first type creates templates for standardized documents by using historical reports and good documentation practices requirements to draft initial versions of standard operating procedures, deviation and corrective and preventive action reports, validation protocols and reports, change control impact assessments, and technology transfer documents, drastically reducing the labor hours needed. These agents can also generate engineering and maintenance reports, such as equipment failure mode and effects analyses and preventive maintenance plans, along with procurement documents such as contracts and requests for proposals. The second type of document agent connects to data sources, such as laboratory information management system testing results and manufacturing execution system process parameters, to generate near-final drafts of documents such as supplemental biologics license application filings for technology transfers. Pilots and early assessments show that documentation agents can achieve 75 to 80 percent productivity gains for initial document generation. Additional benefits are possible through collaboration with document review agents that ensure compliance with regulatory and quality standards. End-to-end document generation and review agents can cut turnaround times from weeks to hours, enabling cross-functional teams to concentrate on final review and approval. 6. Information technology: Transforming IT operations and driving innovation Agentic AI can revolutionize how IT organizations develop and manage technology. Agent-powered application development : The integration of agentic AI into software development is transforming how digital products are designed and built. Instead of relying on product analysts to write user stories, designers to create mockups, and QA analysts to develop test scripts, agents can generate all these components with less oversight. Developers can assemble code using natural language commands rather than traditional programming languages. AI can handle routine coding tasks efficiently, analyze design patterns, and suggest improvements, allowing human designers to focus on creativity and strategic planning. This streamlined process accelerates development and improves the quality of new software products. 16 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI Automation of IT operations : As AI technology advances, traditional IT operations will experience significant changes. Tasks such as issue detection, event correlation, and service-request fulfillment can be fully automated. Agentic AI systems can update continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines enterprise-wide as policies evolve, disseminate insights from new software updates to every deployed system, and perform automated threat monitoring. AI-driven systems can predict and resolve issues before they affect operations, ensuring smoother and more reliable IT services. This automation can save costs, improve service quality, and increase user satisfaction. Accelerating legacy system migration with intelligent automation : Agentic AI can streamline the migration process to modern enterprise systems by automating complex and time-consuming tasks for development teams. Migration agents can analyze legacy systems, map data structures, and identify dependencies to ensure a smooth transition. These agents can also verify data integrity, detect inconsistencies, and automate data cleansing, reducing errors and manual effort. Using AI-driven insights, organizations can accelerate their migration timelines, minimize disruptions, and achieve a seamless transition to the new environment, enabling faster realization of business value. As many organizations rely on systems that are nearing the end of their life cycles\u2014such as enterprise-resource planning\u2014this acceleration is critically needed. While the opportunity to transform IT with AI is real, so too is the burden it will create for IT. Business units and functions are deploying new AI faster than ever and are increasingly experimenting with new technology that is easier to build and deploy. This could create a complex technology landscape that, if left unmanaged, will become the next tranche of legacy systems that will be challenging to operate and keep up-to-date. A Fortune 500 company launched a $600 million initiative to upgrade its aging systems, which included 400 applications, but faced challenges due to slow manual coding processes and inconsistent coordination. AI tools were used to automate code conversion, but they did not significantly accelerate the process. Human workers migrated to supervisory roles, managing teams of more than 100 AI agents responsible for documentation, coding, and testing. This change cut time and effort by over 50 percent. Specialized teams of agents worked on specific features, with their work reviewed and coordinated by other agents. Human supervisors ensured the smooth execution of these agent-managed tasks. The path to implementation Unlocking the full potential of agentic AI in life sciences requires a strategic, organization-wide approach that redefines workflows, roles, and human\u2013agent collaboration. Our Rewired framework offers a concrete foundation to approach this.5 To ensure successful implementation at scale, organizations must focus on several critical enablers: 1. Guide from the top : A clear, top-down mandate from leadership is essential. Leadership\u2019s Unlocking the full potential of agentic AI in life sciences requires a strategic, organization-wide approach that redefines workflows, roles, and human\u2013agent collaboration. 5 \u201cRewired and running ahead: Digital and AI leaders are leaving the rest behind,\u201d McKinsey, January 12, 2024. 17 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI focus should be on aligning agentic AI\u2019s value-creation potential with corporate strategy rather than on technology challenges. Leadership must steer clear of small, incremental improvements by championing a bold vision, setting ambitious goals, and ensuring accountability across functions. 2. Reimagine workflows : Operational leaders should strive to reimagine work in their domains. This involves identifying high-value workflows that can incorporate agents, providing every user with intelligent interfaces to access agent capabilities, and encouraging a culture of innovation and experimentation. A thorough understanding of current processes and the capabilities of agentic AI is essential, from leaders down to the front line. 3. Invest in people : Many roles will change from doing manual and repeatable tasks to setting goals and steering AI agents. Traditional process and people management will migrate toward supervising hybrid teams, leading to changes in organizational structures. Employees will need new skills and tools to activate and supervise agents and overcome the cultural and organizational barriers to adoption. Additionally, new business processes will be needed to measure, monitor, and improve the performance of the agentic workforce. The talent function will play a significant role in managing these transitions and can begin exploring the implications now. 4. Build scalable foundations : To maximize the benefits of AI agents, organizations can invest in flexible interconnected networks of AI agents that enable their rapid development, deployment, and management.6 These \u201cmeshes\u201d include modular, cloud- based architectures that can handle increasing complexity and volume,", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\reimagining-life-science-enterprises-with-agentic-ai.pdf", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 8, "title": "reimagining life science enterprises with agentic ai"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-reimagining-life-science-enterprises-with-agentic-ai-7", "content": ": Operational leaders should strive to reimagine work in their domains.

Agent-to-agent interoperability and the ability to coordinate multiple agents will be key to success. Scalability also requires a robust data infrastructure to ensure agents have access to high-quality, real-time data. Managing data well is key to success and includes aligning the organization on data ontologies and ownership. Strategic partnerships with technology providers and start-ups can provide access to cutting-edge innovation. 5. Establish robust change-management to ensure adoption and value at scale : The transformative potential of agentic AI requires a robust and sustainable change-management strategy. Efforts should include role modeling by executives, a compelling change story, training, ongoing coaching, and incentives to encourage and reward adoption. It should also involve integrating agents into existing business processes, such as management reviews, quarterly business reviews, and sales performance evaluations, along with mechanisms to gather and incorporate feedback. 6. Set risk management and governance guardrails : As agentic AI becomes embedded in critical workflows, it\u2019s best for organizations to establish strong governance frameworks to ensure ethical use. These include clear accountability for decisions made by agents, guardrails to prevent unintended consequences and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, regular audits, and bias-detection mechanisms. 7. Foster a culture of continuous learning : The implementation of agentic AI is a long- term learning challenge for employees and companies. Leaders should establish a strategy for continuous learning and adaptation, including a safe environment for experimentation and a structured approach to skill-building. Organizations must continuously monitor technological advancements, assess new capabilities, and improve their own implementations. 6 \u201cSeizing the agentic AI advantage,\u201d QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, June 13, 2025. 18 Reimagining life science enterprises with agentic AI Copyright \u00a9 2025 McKinsey & Company.

Mobilize an agent factory : A small, centralized group with leadership support can ensure agentic AI is deployed toward the most impactful use cases. The group can facilitate the process for reimagining workflows in collaboration with domain leaders, contribute relevant technology expertise, monitor impact and adoption metrics, and help remove roadblocks to deliver the transformational potential of agentic AI. By addressing these dimensions holistically, life sciences organizations can harness the transformative power of agentic AI to propel innovation, achieve sustainable competitive advantage, and, most importantly, improve patient outcomes.Defining tomorrow The true power of agentic AI lies in its ability to amplify human ingenuity, freeing teams from mundane tasks and unlocking entirely new possibilities for discovery and value creation. By embracing these systems, life science companies can redefine the limits of innovation, accelerate breakthroughs, and deliver life-changing therapies to patients with unprecedented speed and precision. We anticipate that pharmaceutical and medtech companies that embrace this transformation will operate radically differently and more competitively five years from now, with benefits accruing in the meantime.

Many CEOs have greenlit experiments, spun up copilots, and created promising prototypes, but only a handful have seen the needle move on revenue or impact. This report gets to the heart of that paradox: broad adoption with limited return. The current diagnosis is this: Today, AI is bolted on. But to deliver real impact, it must be integrated into core processes, becoming a catalyst for business transformation rather than a sidecar tool. Most deployments today use AI in a shallow way\u2014as an assistant that sits alongside existing workflows and processes\u2014rather than as a deeply integrated, engaged, and powerful agent of transformation. Agentic AI is the catalyst that can make this transition possible, but doing so requires a strategy and a plan to successfully power that transformation. Agents are not simply magical plug-n-play pieces. They must work across systems, reason through ambiguity, and interact with people\u2014not just as tools, but as collaborators. That means CEOs must ask different questions: not \u201cHow do we add AI?\u201d but \u201cHow do we want decisions to be made, work to flow, and humans to engage in an environment where software can act?\u201d Redefining how decisions are made, how work is done, and how humans engage with technology requires alignment across goals, tools, and people. That alignment can only happen when openness, transparency, and control are central to your technology and implementation\u2014when builders have an open, extensible, and observable infrastructure and users can easily craft and use agents with the confidence that the work of agents is safe, reliable, and under their control. That alignment creates the trust and effectiveness that is the currency of scalable transformation that delivers results rather than regrets. The technology to build powerful agents is already here. The opportunity now is to deploy agents in ways that are deeply tied to how value is created and how people work. That requires an architecture that is modular and resilient and, more importantly, an operating model that centers on humans\u2014not just as users but as co-architects of the systems they will be living and working with. This report lays out the playbook not for tinkering but for reinvention. ROI comes from strong intent: define the outcomes, embed agents deep in core workflows, and redesign operating models around them. Organizations that win will pair a clear strategy with tight feedback loops and disciplined governance, using agents to rethink how decisions are made and how work gets done\u2014and turning novelty into measurable value. 3 Seizing the agentic AI advantage At a glance \u2014Nearly eight in ten companies report using gen AI\u2014yet just as many report no significant bottom-line impact.\u00b9 Think of it as the \u201cgen AI paradox.\u201d \u2014At the heart of this paradox is an imbalance between \u201chorizontal\u201d (enterprise-wide) copilots and chatbots\u2014 which have scaled quickly but deliver diffuse, hard-to-measure gains\u2014and more transformative \u201cvertical\u201d (function-specific) use cases\u2014about 90 percent of which remain stuck in pilot mode. \u2014AI agents offer a way to break out of the gen AI paradox. That\u2019s because agents have the potential to automate complex business processes\u2014combining autonomy, planning, memory, and integration\u2014to shift gen AI from a reactive tool to a proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator. \u2014This shift enables far more than efficiency. Agents supercharge operational agility and create new revenue opportunities. \u2014But unlocking the full potential of agentic AI requires more than plugging agents into existing workflows. It calls for reimagining those workflows from the ground up\u2014with agents at the core. \u2014A new AI architecture paradigm\u2014the agentic AI mesh\u2014is needed to govern the rapidly evolving organizational AI landscape and enable teams to blend custom-built and off-the-shelf agents while managing mounting technical debt and new classes of risk. But the bigger challenge won\u2019t be technical. It will be human: earning trust, driving adoption, and establishing the right governance to manage agent autonomy and prevent uncontrolled sprawl. \u2014To scale impact in the agentic era, organizations must reset their AI transformation approaches from scattered initiatives to strategic programs; from use cases to business processes; from siloed AI teams to cross- functional transformation squads; and from experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery. \u2014Organizations will also need to set up the foundation to effectively operate in the agentic era. They will need to upskill the workforce, adapt the technology infrastructure, accelerate data productization, and deploy agent- specific governance mechanisms. The moment has come to bring the gen AI experimentation chapter to a close\u2014a pivot only the CEO can make.

Its potentially transformative power lies not only in the new capabilities gen AI introduces but also in its ability to democratize access to advanced AI technologies across organizations. This democratization has led to widespread growth in awareness of, and experimentation with, AI: According to McKinsey\u2019s most recent Global Survey on AI,5 more than 78 percent of companies are now using gen AI in at least one business function (up from 55 percent a year earlier). However, this enthusiasm has yet to translate into tangible economic results. More than 80 percent of companies still report no material contribution to earnings from their gen AI initiatives.6 What\u2019s more, only 2\u201cThe state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value,\u201d McKinsey, March 12, 2025. 3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023. 4 \u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023. 5 \u201cThe state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value,\u201d McKinsey, March 12, 2025. 6 \u201cThe state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value,\u201d McKinsey, March 12, 2025.\u2022 Nearly eight in ten companies have deployed gen AI in some form, but roughly the same percentage report no material impact on earnings.\u00b2 We call this the \u201cgen AI paradox.\u201d \u2022 The main issue is an imbalance between \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d use cases. The former, such as employee copilots and chatbots, have been widely deployed but deliver diffuse benefits, while higher-impact vertical, or function-specific, use cases seldom make it out of the pilot phase because of technical, organizational, data, and cultural barriers. \u2022 Unless companies address these barriers, the transformational promise of gen AI will remain largely untapped. 6 Seizing the agentic AI advantage Exhibit 1 Organizations that use AI in at least 1 business function,\u00b9 % of respondents 1In 2017, the de/f_inition for AI use was using AI in a core part of the organization\u2019s business or at scale.

At the heart of the gen AI paradox lies an imbalance between horizontal and vertical use cases Many organizations have deployed horizontal use cases, such as enterprise-wide copilots and chatbots; nearly 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, for example, use Microsoft 365 Copilot.8 These tools are widely seen as levers to enhance individual productivity by helping employees save time on routine tasks and access and synthesize information more efficiently. But these improvements, while real, tend to be spread thinly across employees. As a result, they are not easily visible in terms of top- or bottom-line results. 7 Hannah Mayer, Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, and Roger Roberts, \u201cSuperagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI\u2019s full potential,\u201d McKinsey, January 28, 2025. 8 Satya Nadella, \u201cMicrosoft Fiscal Year 2025 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call,\u201d Microsoft, October 30, 2024. 7 Seizing the agentic AI advantage By contrast, vertical use cases\u2014those embedded into specific business functions and processes\u2014have seen limited scaling in most companies despite their higher potential for direct economic impact (Exhibit 2). Fewer than 10 percent of use cases deployed ever make it past the pilot stage, according to McKinsey research.9 Even when they have been fully deployed, these use cases typically have supported only isolated steps of a business process and operated in a reactive mode when prompted by a human, rather than functioning proactively or autonomously. As a result, their impact on business performance also has been limited. 9 New at McKinsey Blog, \u201cMcKinsey\u2019s ecosystem of strategic alliances brings the power of generative AI to clients,\u201d April 2, 2024.

Rapid deployment of enterprise chatbots also has been driven by risk mitigation concerns.

As employees began experimenting with external large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, many organizations implemented internal, secure alternatives to limit data leakage and ensure compliance with corporate security policies. The limited deployment and narrow scope of vertical use cases can in turn be attributed to six primary factors: \u2014Fragmented initiatives. At many companies, vertical use cases have been identified through a bottom-up, highly granular approach within individual functions. In fact, fewer than 30 percent of companies report that their CEOs sponsor their AI agenda directly.10 This has led to a proliferation of disconnected micro-initiatives and a dispersion of AI investments, with limited coordination at the enterprise level. \u2014Lack of mature, packaged solutions. Unlike off-the-shelf horizontal applications, such as copilots, vertical use cases often require custom development. As a result, teams are frequently forced to build from scratch, using emerging, fast-evolving technologies they have limited experience with. While many companies have invested in data scientists to develop AI models, they often lack MLOps engineers, who are critical to industrialize, deploy, and maintain those models in production environments. \u2014Technological limitations of LLMs. Despite their impressive capabilities, the first generation of LLMs faced limitations that significantly constrained their deployment at enterprise scale. First, LLMs can produce inaccurate outputs, which makes them difficult to trust in environments where precision and repeatability are essential. What\u2019s more, despite their power, LLMs are fundamentally passive; they do not act unless prompted and cannot independently drive workflows or make decisions without human initiation. LLMs also have struggled to handle complex workflows involving multiple steps, decision points, or branching logic. Finally, many current LLMs have limited persistent memory, making it difficult to track context over time or operate coherently across extended interactions. \u2014Siloed AI teams. AI centers of excellence have played a crucial role in accelerating awareness and experimentation across many organizations. However, in many cases, these teams have operated in silos\u2014 developing AI models independently from core IT, data, or business functions. This autonomy, while useful for rapid prototyping, has often made solutions difficult to scale because of poor integration with enterprise systems, fragmented data pipelines, or a lack of operational alignment. \u2014Data accessibility and quality gaps. These gaps tend to exist for both structured and unstructured data, with unstructured material remaining largely ungoverned in most organizations. \u2014Cultural apprehension and organizational inertia. In many organizations, AI deployments have encountered implicit resistance from business teams and middle management due to fear of disruption, uncertainty around job impact, and lack of familiarity with the technology. 10\u201cThe state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value,\u201d McKinsey, March 12, 2025. 9 Seizing the agentic AI advantage Despite its limited bottom-line impact so far, the first wave of gen AI has been far from wasted. It has enriched employee capabilities and enabled broad experimentation, accelerated AI familiarity across functions, and helped organizations build essential capabilities in prompt engineering, model evaluation, and governance. All of which has laid the groundwork for a more integrated and transformative second phase\u2014 the emerging age of AI agents.11 11 Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Stephen Xu, \u201cWhy agents are the next frontier of generative AI,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, July 24, 2024. 10 Seizing the agentic AI advantage From paradox to payoff: How agents can scale AI 2 11 Seizing the agentic AI advantage The breakthrough: Automating complex business workflows unlocks the full potential of vertical use cases LLMs have revolutionized how organizations interact with data\u2014enabling information synthesis, content generation, and natural language interaction. But despite their power, LLMs have been fundamentally reactive and isolated from enterprise systems, largely unable to retain memory of past interactions or context across sessions or queries. Their role has been largely limited to enhancing individual productivity through isolated tasks. AI agents mark a major evolution in enterprise AI\u2014extending gen AI from reactive content generation to autonomous, goal-driven execution. Agents can understand goals, break them into subtasks, interact with both humans and systems, execute actions, and adapt in real time\u2014all with minimal human intervention. They do so by combining LLMs with additional technology components providing memory, planning, orchestration, and integration capabilities. With these new capabilities, AI agents expand the potential of horizontal solutions, upgrading general- purpose copilots from passive tools into proactive teammates that don\u2019t just respond to prompts but also monitor dashboards, trigger workflows, follow up on open actions, and deliver relevant insights in real time. But the real breakthrough comes in the vertical realm, where agentic AI enables the automation of complex business workflows involving multiple steps, actors, and systems\u2014processes that were previously beyond the capabilities of first-generation gen AI tools. Agents deliver more than efficiency\u2014they supercharge operational agility and unlock new revenue opportunities On the operations side, agents take on routine, data-heavy tasks so humans can focus on higher-value work. But they go further, transforming processes in five ways: \u2014Agents accelerate execution by eliminating delays between tasks and by enabling parallel processing. Unlike in traditional workflows that rely on sequential handoffs, agents can coordinate and execute multiple steps simultaneously, reducing cycle time and boosting responsiveness.Key points: \u2022 By automating complex business workflows, agents unlock the full potential of vertical use cases. Forward-looking companies are already harnessing the power of agents to transform core processes. \u2022 To realize the potential of agents, companies must reinvent the way work gets done\u2014changing task flows, redefining human roles, and building agent-centric processes from the ground up. \u2022 Accomplishing this will require a new paradigm for AI architecture\u2014the agentic AI mesh\u2014capable of integrating both custom-built and off-the-shelf agents.

This makes workflows not only faster but smarter. \u2014Agents enable personalization. By tailoring interactions and decisions to individual customer profiles or behaviors, agents can adapt the process dynamically to maximize satisfaction and outcomes. \u2014Agents bring elasticity to operations.

Because agents are digital, their execution capacity can expand or contract in real time depending on workload, business seasonality, or unexpected surges\u2014 something difficult to achieve with fixed human resource models. \u2014Agents also make operations more resilient. By monitoring disruptions, rerouting operations, and escalating only when needed, they keep processes running\u2014whether it\u2019s supply chains navigating port delays or service workflows adapting to system outages. In a complex supply chain environment, for example, an AI agent could act as an autonomous orchestration layer across sourcing, warehousing, and distribution operations. Connected to internal systems (such as the supply chain planning system or the warehouse management system) and external data sources (such as weather forecasts, supplier feeds, and demand signals), the agent could continuously forecast demand. It could then identify risks, such as delays or disruptions, and dynamically replan transport and inventory flows. Selecting the optimal transport mode based on cost, lead time, and environmental impact, the agent could reallocate stock across warehouses, negotiate directly with external systems, and escalate decisions requiring strategic input. The result: improved service levels, reduced logistics costs, and lower emissions. Agents can also help spur top-line growth by amplifying existing revenue streams and unlocking entirely new ones: \u2014Amplifying existing revenues. In e-commerce, agents embedded into online stores or apps could proactively analyze user behavior, cart content, and context (for example, seasonality or purchase history) to surface real-time upselling and cross-selling offers. In finance, agents might help customers discover suitable financial products such as loans, insurance plans, or investment portfolios, providing tailored guidance based on financial profiles, life events, and user behavior. \u2014Creating new revenue streams. For industrial companies, agents embedded in connected products or equipment could monitor usage, detect performance thresholds, and autonomously unlock features or trigger maintenance actions\u2014enabling pay-per-use, subscription, or performance-based models of creating revenue. Similarly, service organizations could encapsulate internal expertise\u2014legal reasoning, tax interpretation, and procurement best practices\u2014into AI agents offered as software-as- a-service tools or APIs to clients, partners, or smaller businesses lacking in-house expertise. In short, agentic AI doesn\u2019t just automate. It redefines how organizations operate, adapt, and create value. 13 Seizing the agentic AI advantage No longer science fiction: Forward-looking companies are harnessing the power of agents The following case studies demonstrate how QuantumBlack helps organizations build agent workforces\u2014with outcomes that extend far beyond efficiency gains. Case study 1: How a bank used hybrid \u2018digital factories\u2019 for legacy app modernization The problem: A large bank needed to modernize its legacy core system, which consisted of 400 pieces of software\u2014a massive undertaking budgeted at more than $600 million. Large teams of coders tackled the project using manual, repetitive tasks, which resulted in difficulty coordinating across silos. They also relied on often slow, error-prone documentation and coding. While first-generation gen AI tools helped accelerate individual tasks, progress remained slow and laborious. The agentic approach: Human workers were elevated to supervisory roles, overseeing squads of AI agents, each contributing to a shared objective in a defined sequence (Exhibit 3). These squads retroactively document the legacy application, write new code, review the code of other agents, and integrate code into features that are later tested by other agents prior to delivery of the end product. Freed from repetitive, manual tasks, human supervisors guide each stage of the process, enhancing the quality of deliverables and reducing the number of sprints required to implement new features. Impact: More than 50 percent reduction in time and effort in the early adopter teams Case study 2: How a research firm boosted data quality to derive deeper market insights The problem: A market research and intelligence firm was devoting substantial resources to ensure data quality, relying on a team of more than 500 people whose responsibilities included gathering data, structuring and codifying it, and generating tailored insights for clients. The process, conducted manually, was prone to error, with a staggering 80 percent of mistakes identified by the clients themselves.Exhibit 3 Web <2025> <Seizing the Agentic AI advantage.

It analyzes internal signals, such as changes in product taxonomy, and external events identified via web searches, including product recalls or severe weather. The most influential drivers are synthesized, ranked, and prepared for decision-makers. With advanced search and contextual reasoning, the agents often surface insights that would be difficult for human analysts to uncover manually. While not yet in production, the system is fully functional and has demonstrated strong potential to free up analysts for more strategic work. Impact: More than 60 percent potential productivity gain and expected savings of more than $3 million annually Case study 3: How a bank reimagined the way it creates credit-risk memos The problem: Relationship managers (RMs) at a retail bank were spending weeks writing and iterating credit-risk memos to help make credit decisions and fulfill regulatory requirements (Exhibit 4). This process required RMs to manually review and extract information from at least ten different data sources and develop complex nuanced reasoning across interdependent sections\u2014for instance, loan, revenue, and cash joint evolution. The agentic approach: In close collaboration with the bank\u2019s credit-risk experts and RMs, a proof of concept was developed to transform the credit memo workflow using AI agents. The agents assist RMs by extracting data, drafting memo sections, generating confidence scores to prioritize review, and suggesting relevant follow- up questions. In this model, the analyst\u2019s role shifts from manual drafting to strategic oversight and exception handling.

It instead calls for a shift in design mindset\u2014from automating tasks within an existing process to reinventing the entire process with human and agentic coworkers. That\u2019s because when agents are embedded into a legacy process without redesign, they typically serve as faster assistants\u2014generating content, retrieving data, or executing predefined steps. But the process itself remains sequential, rule bound, and shaped by human constraints. Reinventing a process around agents means more than layering automation on top of existing workflows\u2014it involves rearchitecting the entire task flow from the ground up. That includes reordering steps, reallocating responsibilities between humans and agents, and designing the process to fully exploit the strengths of agentic AI: parallel execution that collapses cycle time, real-time adaptability that reacts to changing conditions, deep personalization at scale, and elastic capacity that flexes instantly with demand. Consider a hypothetical customer call center. Before introducing AI agents, the facility was using gen AI tools to assist human support staff by retrieving articles from knowledge bases, summarizing ticket histories, and helping draft responses. While this assistance improved speed and reduced cognitive load, the process itself remained entirely manual and reactive, with human agents still managing every step of diagnosis, coordination, and resolution. The productivity improvement potential was modest, typically boosting resolution time and productivity between 5 and 10 percent. Now imagine that the call center introduces AI agents but largely preserves the existing workflow\u2014 agents are added to assist at specific steps without reconfiguring how work is routed, tracked, or resolved end-to-end. Agents can classify tickets, suggest likely root causes, propose resolution paths, and even autonomously resolve frequent, low-complexity issues (such as password resets). While the impact here can be increased\u2014an estimated 20 to 40 percent savings in time and a 30 to 50 percent reduction in backlog\u2014coordination friction and limited adaptability prevent true breakthrough gains. But the real shift occurs at the third level, when the call center\u2019s process is reimagined around agent autonomy. In this model, AI agents don\u2019t just respond\u2014they proactively detect common customer issues (such as delayed shipments, failed payments, or service outages) by monitoring patterns across channels, anticipate likely needs, initiate resolution steps automatically (such as issuing refunds, reordering items, or updating account details), and communicate directly with customers via chat or email. Human agents are repositioned as escalation managers and service quality overseers, who are brought in only when agents detect uncertainty or exceptions to typical patterns. Impact at this level is transformative. This could allow a radical improvement of customer service desk productivity. Up to 80 percent of common incidents could be resolved autonomously, with a reduction in time to resolution of 60 to 90 percent (Exhibit 5). Of course, not every business process requires full reinvention. Simple task automation is sufficient for highly standard, repetitive workflows with limited variability\u2014such as payroll processing, travel expense approvals, or password resets\u2014where gains come primarily from reducing manual effort. In contrast, processes that are complex, cross-functional, prone to exceptions, or tightly linked to business performance often warrant full redesign. Key indicators that call for reinvention include high coordination overhead, rigid sequences that delay responsiveness, frequent human intervention for decisions that could be data driven, and opportunities for dynamic adaptation or personalization. In these cases, redesigning the process around the agent\u2019s ability to orchestrate, adapt, and learn delivers far greater value than simply speeding up existing workflows. 16 Seizing the agentic AI advantage A new AI architecture paradigm\u2014the agentic AI mesh\u2014is required to orchestrate value in the agentic era To scale agents, companies will need to overcome a threefold challenge: handling the newfound risks that AI agents bring, blending custom and off-the-shelf agentic systems, and staying agile amid fast- evolving tech (while avoiding lock-ins). \u2014Managing a new wave of risks. Agents introduce a new class of systemic risks that traditional gen AI architectures, designed primarily for isolated LLM-centric use cases, were never built to handle: uncontrolled autonomy, fragmented system access, lack of observability and traceability, expanding surface of attack, and agent sprawl and duplication. What starts as intelligent automation can quickly become operational chaos\u2014unless it is built on a foundation that prioritizes control, scalability, and trust. \u2014Blending custom and off-the-shelf agents. To fully capture the transformative potential of AI agents, organizations must go beyond simply activating agents embedded in software suites. These off-the-shelf agents may streamline routine workflows, but they rarely unlock strategic advantage. Realizing the full potential of agentic AI will require the development of custom-built agents for high- impact processes, such as end-to-end customer resolution, adaptive supply chain orchestration, or complex decision-making. These agents must be deeply aligned with the company\u2019s logic, data flows, and value creation levers\u2014making them difficult to replicate and uniquely powerful. \u2014Staying agile amid fast-evolving tech. Agentic AI is a new technology area, and solutions are evolving very rapidly. Agents will have to support workflows across multiple systems and should not be hardwired within a specific platform.

Agentic AI is a new technology area, and solutions are evolving very rapidly. Agents will have to support workflows across multiple systems and should not be hardwired within a specific platform.

While such capabilities are necessary, they are not sufficient. What\u2019s needed is a fundamental architectural shift: from static, LLM-centric infrastructure to a dynamic, modular, and governed environment built specifically for agent-based intelligence\u2014the agentic AI mesh. The agentic AI mesh is a composable, distributed, and vendor-agnostic architectural paradigm that enables multiple agents to reason, collaborate, and act autonomously across a wide array of systems, tools, and language models\u2014securely, at scale, and built to evolve with the technology. At the heart of this paradigm are five mutually reinforcing design principles: \u2014Composability. Any agent, tool, or LLM can be plugged into the mesh without system rework. \u2014Distributed intelligence. Tasks can be decomposed and resolved by networks of cooperating agents. \u2014Layered decoupling. Logic, memory, orchestration, and interface functions are decoupled to maximize modularity. \u2014Vendor neutrality. All components can be independently updated or replaced as technology advances, avoiding vendor lock-in and future-proofing the architecture. In particular, open standards such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) are preferred to proprietary protocols. \u2014Governed autonomy. Agent behavior is proactively controlled via embedded policies, permissions, and escalation mechanisms that ensure safe, transparent operation. The agentic AI mesh acts as the connective and orchestration layer that enables large-scale, intelligent agent ecosystems to operate safely and efficiently, and continuously evolve. It allows companies to coordinate custom-built and off-the-shelf agents within a unified framework, support multiagent collaboration by allowing agents to share context and delegate tasks, and mitigate key risks such as agent sprawl, autonomy drift, and lack of observability\u2014all while preserving the agility required for a rapid technology evolution (see sidebar \u201cSeven interconnected capabilities of the AI agentic mesh\u201d). Beyond this architectural evolution, organizations will also have to revisit their LLM strategies. At the core of every custom agent lies a foundation model\u2014the reasoning engine that powers perception, decision- making, and interaction. In the agentic era, the requirements placed on LLMs evolve significantly. Agents are not passive copilots\u2014they are autonomous, persistent, embedded systems. This creates five critical categories of LLM requirements, each aligned with specific deployment contexts, for which different kinds of models will be relevant (see sidebar \u201cFoundational models for agents: Five requirements\u201d). Finally, to truly scale agent deployment across the enterprise, the enterprise systems themselves must also evolve. In the short term, APIs\u2014protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data\u2014will remain the primary interface for agents to interact with enterprise systems. But in the long term, APIs alone will not suffice. Organizations must begin reimagining their IT architectures around an agent-first model\u2014one in which user interfaces, logic, and data access layers are natively designed for machine interaction rather than human navigation. In such a model, systems are no longer organized around screens and forms but around machine-readable interfaces, autonomous workflows, and agent-led decision flows. 18 Seizing the agentic AI advantage This shift is already underway. Microsoft is embedding agents into the core of Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 via Copilot Studio; Salesforce is expanding Agentforce into a multiagent orchestration layer; SAP is rearchitecting its Business Technology Platform (BTP) to support agent integration through Joule. These changes signal a broader transition: The future of enterprise software is not just AI-augmented\u2014it is agent- native. The main challenge won\u2019t be technical\u2014it will be human As agents evolve from passive copilots to proactive actors\u2014and scale across the enterprise\u2014the complexity they introduce will be not only technical but mostly organizational. The real challenge lies in coordination, judgment, and trust. This organizational complexity will play out most visibly across three dimensions: how humans and agents cohabit day-to-day workflows; how organizations establish governance over systems that can act autonomously; and how they prevent unchecked sprawl as agent creation becomes increasingly democratized. \u2014Human\u2013agent cohabitation. Agents won\u2019t just assist humans\u2014they\u2019ll act alongside them. This raises nuanced questions about interaction and coexistence: When should an agent take initiative? When should it defer? How do we maintain human agency and oversight without slowing down the very 1. Agent and workflow discovery maintains a dynamic catalog of all organizational agents and workflows, enabling reuse across teams and enforcing policies on agent use. 2. AI asset registry centralizes governance of system prompts, agent instructions, large-language-model (LLM) configurations, tool definitions, and golden records while creating policies about version control and access. 3. Observability provides end-to-end tracing of workflows spanning agentic and procedural systems through standardized metrics, audit logs, and diagnostic capabilities. 4. Authentication and authorization enforce fine-grain access controls for communication among agentic systems, procedural systems, and LLMs, enforcing security policies and limiting the \u201cblast radius\u201d of compromised systems or agents. 5. Evaluations deliver comprehensive testing of agent pipelines to ensure accuracy and compliance over time. 6. Feedback management enables continuous improvement through automated feedback loops that capture performance metrics to evolve agent configurations. 7. Compliance and risk management embed policy controls, compliance agents, and ethical guardrails to ensure workflows meet regulatory and institutional standards. Seven interconnected capabilities of the AI agentic mesh The emerging architecture for agentic AI relies on seven interconnected capabilities: 19 Seizing the agentic AI advantage 1. Low-latency inference for real-time responsiveness. Agents embedded in workflows (such as service operations or IT alerts) require subsecond response times with predictable latency, even under compute constraints. Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mistral Small (Mistral AI), Llama 3 8B (Meta), Gemini Nano (Google), and Claude Haiku (Anthropic). 2. Fine-tuning and controllability for domain-specific agents. Agents operating in regulated or knowledge-intensive domains (such as finance, legal, and healthcare) need large language models (LLMs) that can be fine-tuned, grounded in enterprise knowledge, and instrumented with external tools (such as RAG and APIs).

Lightweight deployment for embedded and edge agents. In cases such as the Internet of Things, field devices, or privacy-sensitive environments, agents must be embedded directly into software or hardware, with minimal compute and memory footprint. Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mistral Small (Mistral AI), Gemini Nano (Google), Llama 3 8B (Meta), and Phi-2 (Microsoft). 4. Scalable multiagent orchestration across the enterprise. Enterprises deploying hundreds or thousands of agents require LLMs that can scale efficiently and cost-effectively, ideally using sparse architectures or a mixture of experts. Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mixtral (Mistral AI), Grok-1 (xAI), GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI), and Command R+ (Cohere). 5. Sovereignty, auditability, and geopolitical resilience for autonomous agents. Agents embedded in core operations\u2014particularly in public, financial, and critical- infrastructure sectors\u2014must ensure compliance, data sovereignty, traceability, and geopolitical autonomy. This includes avoiding reliance on APIs that are hosted abroad, ensuring data residency, and resisting extraterritorial legal exposure (for example, OpenAI or Anthropic subject to US subpoenas). Illustrative examples of relevant models include Mistral Small/Mixtral (Mistral AI), Falcon 180B (TII UAE), and BloomZ/Bloom (BigScience).Foundational models for agents: Five requirements A few characteristics are key for LLM providers to take into account in the agentic era: benefits agents bring? Building clarity around these roles will take time, experimentation, and cultural adjustment. Trust won\u2019t come from technical performance alone\u2014it will hinge on how transparently agents communicate, how predictably they behave, and how intuitively they integrate into daily workflows. \u2014Autonomy control. What makes agents powerful\u2014their ability to act independently\u2014also introduces ambiguity. Unlike traditional tools, agents don\u2019t wait to be instructed. They respond, adapt, and sometimes surprise. Navigating this new reality means confronting edge cases: What if an agent executes too aggressively? Or fails to escalate a subtle issue? The challenge is not to eliminate autonomy but to make it intelligible and aligned with organizational expectations. That alignment won\u2019t be static. 20 Seizing the agentic AI advantage It will need to evolve as agents learn, systems shift, and trust deepens. Control mechanisms must also address the risk of hallucinations, or plausible but inaccurate outputs agents may produce. \u2014Sprawl containment. As in the early days of robotic process automation, there\u2019s a real risk of agent sprawl\u2014the uncontrolled proliferation of redundant, fragmented, and ungoverned agents across teams and functions. As low-code and no-code platforms make agent creation accessible to anyone, organizations risk a new kind of shadow IT: agents that multiply across teams, duplicate efforts, or operate without oversight. How do we avoid fragmentation? Who decides what gets built\u2014and what gets retired? Without structured governance, design standards, and life cycle management, agent ecosystems can quickly become fragile, redundant, and unscalable. Agents unlock the full potential of vertical use cases, offering companies a path to generate value well beyond efficiency gains. But realizing that potential requires a reimagined approach to AI transformation\u2014 one tailored to the unique nature of agents and capable of addressing the lingering limitations they alone cannot resolve. This approach is the subject of our next chapter. 21 Seizing the agentic AI advantage AI transformation at a tipping point: The CEO mandate in the agentic era 3 22 Seizing the agentic AI advantage Key points: \u2022 Generating impact in the agentic era requires organizations to shift from scattered initiatives to strategic programs; from use cases to business processes; from siloed AI teams to cross-functional transformation squads; and from experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery. \u2022 To scale agents, organizations will also need to set a new foundation by upskilling the workforce, adapting the technology infrastructure, and developing new governance structures for agents. \u2022 The time has come to bring the gen AI experimentation phase to an end\u2014a pivot only the CEO can make. Scaling impact in the agentic era requires a reset of the AI transformation approach Unlike gen AI tools that could be easily plugged into existing workflows, AI agents demand a more foundational shift, one that requires rethinking business processes and enabling deep integration with enterprise systems. McKinsey has a proven Rewired playbook for digital transformations.12 To capitalize on the agentic opportunity, organizations must build on that, fundamentally reshaping their AI transformation approach across four dimensions: \u2014Strategy: From scattered tactical initiatives to strategic programs. With agentic AI set to reshape the foundations of competition, organizations must move beyond bottom-up use case identification and directly align AI initiatives with their most critical strategic priorities. This means not only translating existing goals\u2014such as enhancing operational efficiency, improving customer intimacy, or strengthening compliance\u2014into AI-addressable transformation domains, but also adopting a forward-looking lens. Executives must challenge their organizations to look beyond the boundaries of today\u2019s operating model and explore how AI can be used to reimagine entire segments of the business, create new revenue streams, and build competitive moats that will define leadership in the next decade. \u2014Unit of transformation: From use case to business processes. In the early wave of gen AI adoption, most vertical initiatives focused on plugging a solution into a specific step of an existing process\u2014 which tended to deliver narrow gains without changing the overall structure of how work is done. With AI agents, the paradigm shifts entirely. Opportunity now lies not in optimizing isolated tasks but in transforming entire business processes by embedding agents throughout the value chain. As a result, AI initiatives should no longer be scoped around a single use case, but instead around the end-to-end reinvention of a full process or persona journey. In vertical domains, this means moving from the question, \u201cWhere can I use AI in this function?\u201d to \u201cWhat would this function look like if agents ran 60 percent of it?\u201d It involves rethinking workflows, decision logic, human\u2013system interactions, and performance metrics across the board. 12Eric Lamarre, Kate Smaje, and Rodney Zemmel, \u201cRewired to outcompete,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, June 20, 2023. 23 Seizing the agentic AI advantage \u2014Delivery model: From siloed AI teams to cross-functional transformation squads.

AI centers of excellence have played a key role in accelerating AI awareness and experimentation across organizations. However, this model reaches its limits in the agentic era\u2014in which agents are deeply embedded into enterprise systems, operate across complex business processes, and rely on high- quality data as their primary fuel. In this context, AI initiatives can no longer be delivered by isolated, specialized AI teams. To succeed at scale, organizations must shift to a cross-functional delivery model, anchored in durable transformation squads composed of business domain experts, process designers, AI and MLOps engineers, IT architects, software engineers, and data engineers. \u2014Implementation process: From experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery. While the previous phase rightly focused on exploring the potential of gen AI, organizations must now shift to an industrialized delivery model, in which solutions are designed from the outset to scale, both technically and financially. This requires organizations to anticipate the full set of technical prerequisites for enterprise deployment\u2014notably in terms of system integration, day-to-day monitoring, and release management, but also to rigorously estimate future running costs and design a solution to minimize them. Unlike traditional IT systems\u2014for which annual run costs typically represent 10 to 20 percent of initial build costs13\u2014gen AI solutions, especially at scale, can incur recurring costs that exceed the initial build investment. Designing for scalability must therefore include not just technical robustness but also economic sustainability, especially for high-volume applications. Four critical enablers are required to effectively operate in the agentic era Redesigning the approach to AI transformation is an important step, but it is not enough. To unlock their full potential at scale, organizations must also activate a robust set of enablers that support the structural, cultural, and technical shifts required to integrate agents into day-to-day operations. These enablers span four dimensions\u2014people, governance, technology architecture, and data\u2014each of which is a foundation for scalable, secure, and high-impact deployment of agents across the enterprise. \u2014People: Equip the workforce and introduce new roles. The workforce must be equipped for new ways of working driven by human\u2013agent collaboration. This involves fostering a \u201chuman + agent\u201d mindset through cultural change, targeted training, and supporting early adopters as internal champions. New roles must also be introduced, such as prompt engineers to refine interactions, agent orchestrators to manage agent workflows, and human-in-the-loop designers to handle exceptions and build trust. \u2014Governance: Ensure autonomy control and prevent agent sprawl. With the rise of autonomous agents comes the need for strong governance to avoid risk and uncontrolled sprawl. Enterprises should define governance frameworks that establish agent autonomy levels, decision boundaries, behavior monitoring, and audit mechanisms. Policies for development, deployment, and usage must also be formalized, along with classification systems that group agents by function (such as task automators, domain orchestrators, and virtual collaborators), each with an appropriate oversight model. \u2014Technology architecture: Build a foundation for interoperability and scale. Agents, whether custom- built or off-the-shelf, must operate across a fragmented ecosystem of systems, data, and workflows. In the short term, organizations must evolve their AI architecture from LLM-centric setups to an agentic 13Aykut Atali, Chandra Gnanasambandam, and Bhargs Srivathsan, \u201cTransforming infrastructure operations for a hybrid-cloud world,\u201d McKinsey, October 9, 2019. 24 Seizing the agentic AI advantage AI mesh. Beyond this first step, organizations should start preparing for their next-generation architecture, in which all enterprise systems will be reshuffled around agents in terms of user interface, business logic, and day-to-day operations. \u2014Data: Accelerate data productization and address quality gaps in unstructured data. Finally, agents depend on the quality and accessibility of enterprise data. Organizations must transition from use-case-specific data pipelines to reusable data products and extend data governance to unstructured data. CEOs have a leadership challenge: Bringing the gen AI experimentation phase to a close The rise of AI agents is more than just a technological shift. Agents represent a strategic inflection point that will redefine how companies operate, compete, and create value. To navigate this transition successfully, organizations must move beyond experimentation and pilot programs and enter a new phase of scaled, enterprise-wide transformation. This pivot cannot be delegated\u2014it must be initiated and led by the CEO. It will rely on three key actions: \u2014Action 1: Conclude the experimentation phase and realign AI priorities. Conduct a structured review to capture lessons learned, retire unscalable pilots, and formally close the exploratory phase. Refocus efforts on strategic AI programs targeting high-impact domains and processes. \u2014Action 2: Redesign the AI governance and operating model. Set up a strategic AI council involving business leaders, the chief human resources officer, the chief data officer, and the chief information officer. This council should oversee AI direction-setting; coordinate AI, IT, and data investments; and implement rigorous value-tracking mechanisms based on KPIs tied to business outcomes. \u2014Action 3: Launch a first lighthouse transformation project and simultaneously initialize the agentic AI tech foundation. Kick off a select number of high-impact agentic AI\u2013driven workflow transformations in core business areas. In parallel, lay the groundwork for an agentic AI technology foundation by investing in key enablers\u2014technology infrastructure, data quality, governance frameworks, and workforce readiness. 25 Seizing the agentic AI advantage Conclusion Like any truly disruptive technology, AI agents have the power to reshuffle the deck. Done right, they offer laggards a leapfrog opportunity to rewire their competitiveness. Done wrong\u2014or not at all\u2014they risk accelerating the decline of today\u2019s market leaders. This is a moment of strategic divergence. While the technology will continue to evolve, it is already mature enough to drive real, transformative change across industries. But to realize the full promise of agentic AI, CEOs must rethink their approach to AI transformation\u2014not as a series of scattered pilots but as focused, end-to-end reinvention efforts. That means identifying a few business domains with the highest potential and pulling every lever: from reimagining workflows to redistributing tasks between humans and machines to rewiring the organization based on new operating models. Some leaders are already moving\u2014not just by deploying fleets of agents but by rewiring their organizations to harness their full disruptive potential.

This is a structural move toward a new kind of enterprise. Agentic AI is not an incremental step\u2014it is the foundation of the next-generation operating model. CEOs who act now won\u2019t just gain a performance edge. They will redefine how their organizations think, decide, and execute. The time for exploration is ending. The time for transformation is now. Copyright \u00a9 2025 McKinsey & Company.

AI is bringing the largest organizational paradigm shift since the industrial and digital revolutions (see sidebar, \u201cThe evolution of operating models\u201d). This new paradigm unites humans and AI agents \u2014both virtual and physical\u2014to work side by side at scale at near-zero marginal cost. We call it the agentic organization. McKinsey\u2019s experience working with early adopters indicates that AI agents can unlock significant value . Organizations are beginning to deploy virtual AI agents along a spectrum of increasing complexity: from simple tools that augment existing activities to end-to-end workflow automation to entire \u201cAI-first\u201d agentic systems. In parallel, physical AI agents are emerging. Companies are making strides in developing \u201cbodies\u201d for AI, such as smart devices, drones, self- driving vehicles, and early attempts at humanoid robots . These machines allow AI to interface with the physical world. The evolution of operating models In the agricultural era prior to the 1800s, operating models were simple and centered around small teams of craftspeople and farmers. Eighty to 90 percent of the global population worked in agriculture.1 Next, in the industrial era , people moved into factories, and operating models shifted to functional hierarchies. Products were designed for mass replication by people and machines, with major upgrades every three to ten years. New roles emerged, such as factory workers, engineers, and shift supervisors. By the 1970s, 39 percent of people in the United States worked in the industrial sector, with just 4 percent in agriculture.2 Efficient scaling drove companies\u2019 growth and competitive advantage, and lean management became a strategic tool. As the digital era launched in the 1990s, industrial-age maxims began crumbling with the rise of computing. Early IT efforts 1 Marian L.

Today, 5.8 percent of the US population is employed in tech jobs,4 with only 1.6 percent in agriculture5 and 19.3 percent in the industrial sector.6 Now, the AI era is beginning to usher in the newest evolution, revolutionizing knowledge work like the previous eras revolutionized physical work, with the agentic organization bringing together humans, AI agents, and machines in the workplace of the future.The promise of this new paradigm will depend upon the continued growth of AI\u2019s capabilities, as well as other factors such as regulation. The length of tasks that AI can reliably complete doubled approximately every seven months since 2019 and every four months since 2024, reaching roughly two hours as of this writing.7 AI systems could potentially complete four days of work without supervision by 2027. This would be a phenomenally accelerated evolution\u2014 from an intern-level employee requiring constant supervision to a mid-tenure employee who can operate independently to, perhaps, a senior executive who can shape and drive strategies. Organizational paradigms do coexist. But the agentic organization may offer the key for the leaders to gain a competitive advantage by building decentralized outcomes-focused agentic networks. 2 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era The agentic organization will be built around five pillars of the enterprise: business model; operating model; governance; workforce, people, and culture; and technology and data (Exhibit 1). Imagine, for instance, the bank of tomorrow: When a customer wants to buy a house, a personal AI concierge activates a series of agentic workflows to serve the buyer. A real estate AI agent suggests properties, while a mortgage underwriting agent tailors offers based on the customer\u2019s financial profile. Compliance agents ensure that the deal adheres to bank policies, and a contracting agent finalizes agreements before another agent fulfills the loan. All these workflows are overseen by an agentic team of human supervisors, mortgage experts, and AI-empowered frontline employees. In some cases, the bank could even extend its AI-powered services into furnishing, renovations, energy upgrades, and more. The bank becomes a network of agentic teams\u2014an agentic organization.

The agentic organization paradigm will undoubtedly evolve, but today\u2019s leaders cannot wait for perfect clarity. In this article, we point leaders to where they can act now to shape the new era\u2014refining their operating models to create more value and rewiring for an AI-first approach\u2014instead of waiting to be shaped by it. Five pillars of the agentic organization 1. Business model In the agentic era, companies will gain a competitive advantage by getting closer to customers via AI channels to offer real-time hyperpersonalization, streamlining processes to become AI-first, and building a walled garden of proprietary data as their superpower. AI-native start-ups and agentic companies can potentially disrupt industries, with a fundamentally different level of productivity (revenue per employee), cost decoupled from growth, and greater speed to market and innovation. AI-native channels enable hyperpersonalization Consumers are already bypassing shops, apps, and search engines in favor of AI-native interfaces such as ChatGPT. In the future, every consumer could have a low-cost AI personal assistant . One European utility provider has rolled out a multimodal AI assistant to its three million customers. It significantly reduced average handling times, boosted customer satisfaction, improved response speed, and resolved more calls without a human. These assistants won\u2019t just respond; they are personal concierges that will negotiate with other agents 24/7, continuously learning from user behavior and market signals to generate ever-evolving, hyperpersonalized products. This also unlocks new opportunities for the ecosystem economy , in which companies that own customer contact can grow by meeting various customer needs beyond their traditional business model and industry boundaries. AI-first workflows drive marginal costs toward the cost of compute Banks already run mortgage and compliance processes with agent squads. Insurers are reinventing claims and underwriting, while reimagining themselves as AI-native. Telcos are using agents in customer service and beyond . One global bank\u2019s \u201cagent factory\u201d manages know-your- customer processes with ten agent squads, which has helped achieve a substantial positive impact on the quality and consistency of output. Another bank has used humans to oversee squads of AI agents in modernizing its legacy core systems, enabling up to 50 percent reductions in time and effort. This is not automation as usual on top of existing processes\u2014it\u2019s a redesign of end-to-end processes with humans \u201cabove the loop\u201d for strategic oversight, with potential to bring the marginal cost toward the cost of compute. Going forward, most, if not all, processes can be reimagined as AI-first, with humans and traditional IT systems selectively introduced back in the loop or above the loop. Proprietary data becomes a key differentiator If today\u2019s AI is \u201can intern with the internet in its pocket,\u201d tomorrow\u2019s edge will come from the walled data gardens that the public internet doesn\u2019t offer. Companies can outperform their competition by continuously capturing and refining unique, consented, proprietary data\u2014such as streams of customer behavior, product usage, and sensor data\u2014and converting them into differentiating personalized products and processes. AI can also help by accelerating the build- up of data foundations and data products , as well as data-quality improvements. 4 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era 2. Operating model In the agentic era, how organizations are built and operate will evolve as much as the products or services they deliver. Work and workflows will be reimagined as AI-first, and operating models will evolve to flat networks of empowered, outcome-aligned agentic teams. Work and workflows will be reimagined as AI-first The operating model of the agentic era will be anchored around reimagined AI-first workflows, with humans and IT systems selectively reintroduced in AI-native design. At a European automaker and a public sector organization, squads of agents are reverse-engineering and modernizing legacy systems while humans steer and validate work. In product development, agents can gather feedback, analyze data, test features, and even run campaigns. Humans will be mostly positioned above the loop to steer and direct outcomes and selectively within the loop where human contact matters. Outcome-aligned agentic teams will be organizational building blocks Traditional organizations have been built around functional silos. Digital companies have cross- functional product teams but are still constrained by handovers and human team size limitations, such as the two-pizza team1 and Dunbar\u2019s number.2 In the agentic organization, structure will pivot to small, outcome-focused agentic teams. An agentic team\u2014a smaller group of multidisciplinary humans who own and supervise the underlying AI workflows\u2014can be organized to deliver clear end-to-end business outcomes covering the full functional value chain of marketing, product management, technology, data, and operations. In our experience, a human team of two to five people can already supervise an agent factory of 50 to 100 specialized agents running an end-to-end process such as onboarding a customer, launching a product, or closing the books. Agentic AI can extend the scope and autonomy of a product team more than ever. Winners orchestrate flat networks of agentic teams Proliferation of AI agents without the right context, steering, and orientation can be a recipe for chaos. Winning operating models of the future will empower agentic teams, with flat decision and communication structures that operate with high context sharing and alignment across agentic teams to ensure they move in sync. Organization charts (based on traditional hierarchical delegation) will pivot toward agentic networks or work charts (based on exchanging tasks and outcomes).3 Finally, agentic networks are not necessarily limited to the boundaries of a single", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\the-agentic-organization-contours-of-the-next-paradigm-for-the-ai-era.pdf", "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 5, "title": "the agentic organization contours of the next paradigm for the ai era"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-the-agentic-organization-contours-of-the-next-paradigm-for-the-ai-era-2", "content": "two-pizza team1 and Dunbar\u2019s number.2 In the agentic organization, structure will pivot to small, outcome-focused agentic teams.

Organization charts (based on traditional hierarchical delegation) will pivot toward agentic networks or work charts (based on exchanging tasks and outcomes).3 Finally, agentic networks are not necessarily limited to the boundaries of a single organization, and different outcomes may be sourced from different parties, opening up new B2B opportunities. 3. Governance In the agentic organization, governance cannot remain a periodic, paper-heavy exercise. As agents operate continuously, governance must become real time, data driven, and embedded\u2014 with humans holding final accountability. Decision-making accelerates with real-time data Traditional budgeting, planning, and performance management cycles are too slow for AI-first workflows. Early movers are experimenting with \u201cagentic budgeting,\u201d in which AI agents propose budgets, scenario agents run forecasts, and reporting agents provide real-time insights. Finance 1 Martin Fowler, \u201cTwo pizza team,\u201d MartinFowler.com, July 25, 2023. 2 \u201cDunbar\u2019s number, psychological safety and team size,\u201d Psych Safety, October 21, 2022. 3 2025: The year the frontier firm is born , Microsoft, April 23, 2025. 5 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era leaders shift from collecting spreadsheets to interpreting signals, stress-testing scenarios, and engaging directly with the business. Agents control agents through embedded guardrails Just as DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) embedded automated checks into digital delivery, agentic organizations will embed control agents into workflows. Critic agents will challenge outputs, guardrail agents will enforce policy, and compliance agents will monitor regulation. Every action can be logged and explained in real time\u2014from data privacy to financial thresholds to brand voice. An AI governance framework across the life cycle of AI agents\u2014from agent discovery and initiation to decommissioning\u2014can balance speed and scale with the required security and control mechanisms. Human accountability and oversight remain Human accountability and oversight will remain essential, but their nature will change. Rather than conduct line-by-line reviews, compliance officers and leaders will define policies, monitor outliers, and adjust the level of human involvement. The challenge is finding the sweet spot: enough oversight to manage risk without pulling agents back to human speed. Companies that get this balance right will capture more of the agentic advantage. Ultimately, the scale of agentic adoption will be capped by how much oversight capacity humans can provide\u2014making governance itself a potential bottleneck to productivity. 4. Workforce, people, and culture In the agentic organization, humans will move from executing activities to owning and steering end-to-end outcomes. That shift demands new profiles with different skills and a culture that provides cohesion and purpose. The hybrid agentic workforce needs a new talent system As agents take on execution, people will increasingly define goals, make trade-offs, and steer outcomes. This will change how companies plan for a hybrid workforce, whom they hire (or borrow), how they deploy human or AI talent, and how they measure success. HR systems not only track human employees but also are a repository of agents and agentic workflows. Performance management anchored in task completion will give way to systems that track how well people orchestrate agents, unlock value, and deliver outcomes. In this new paradigm, the talent system itself must be rethought\u2014from career paths to incentives to leadership models. New talent profiles with different skills emerge In our work with pioneering organizations, we see AI agents replacing tasks historically handled by knowledge workers, such as analyzing documents and creating APIs. At the same time, we see rising demand for other skills\u2014for example, deep problem-solving with an end-to-end lens, application of system design, and the ability to apply pattern recognition to edge cases where agents fail. Three roles are emerging as humans work alongside agents (Exhibit 2): \u2014M-shaped supervisors: broad generalists fluent in AI, orchestrating agents and the hybrid workforce across domains \u2014T-shaped experts: deep specialists who reimagine workflows, handle exceptions, and safeguard quality 6 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era \u2014AI-augmented frontline workers: employees in sales, service, HR, or operations who spend less time on systems and more time with humans Leaders themselves will also evolve. CEOs, product officers, and compliance heads will increasingly need the technology fluency once expected only of chief information officers. Filling these roles will require upskilling and reskilling at scale . Early evidence shows that employees without technical backgrounds can learn to manage agentic workflows as quickly as trained engineers. Career paths and performance systems will need to adapt as \u201cboxes and lines\u201d give way to ecosystems of human and digital skills. As these profiles take hold, the constructs of \u201corganization\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d will become more fluid, with ecosystems of human and digital talent blending inside and outside an organization. Culture acts as glue and ethical compass Culture will become both the operating glue and the ethical compass of the agentic organization. Pioneering agentic organizations highlight the need for orchestration\u2014to align teams around shared context and outcomes, identify the right mix of human and AI capabilities (as not everything needs agentic AI), and build trust between humans and agents. The culture compass embeds values and long-term purpose into agentic systems, so companies don\u2019t chase short-Exhibit 2Web <2025> <AgenticAI3> Exhibit <for pdf?> of <3> Skills required for evolving roles in the AI era Gaps measured against roles today 1For example, critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, decision-making, abstract thinking.New talent pro/f_iles for supervisors, specialists, and frontline workers will emerge in the agentic organization.

Early pioneers show that clarity, decisive leadership, and continuous learning are critical\u2014but what will differentiate winners is their ability to preserve cohesion and identity while transforming at pace. 5. Technology and data In the agentic organization, technology and data will get democratized, supported by an agentic AI mesh . Agent-to-agent protocols will make integration across systems, machines, and humans easier and cheaper. Successful scalers will balance build-versus-buy decisions based on sources of distinctiveness and competitive advantage, avoiding technology or vendor lock-in so they can adapt quickly to a fast-evolving offering landscape. Distributed ownership of IT and data becomes feasible In the digital era, technology and data systems evolved from centralized monoliths and databases sitting far from the business toward microservices and data products sitting close to the business. This required significant software and data engineering expertise to design, develop, and maintain the underlying technology and data. In the emerging agentic age, business-side employees will be able to independently create software assets and manage data through agentic AI, which automates the software development life cycle (SDLC) with oversight from deep specialists. Early adopters have seen productivity at least double, with employees from diverse backgrounds\u2014such as a French literature graduate in one of our teams\u2014proving as capable as software engineers in building agentic workflows. To scale this transformation responsibly, organizations must adopt agentic platforms and architectures, such as an agentic AI mesh . These platforms provide reusable, high-performing \u201catomic\u201d agents and data products equipped with technical safety guardrails to prevent buildup of technical debt or cybersecurity risks, while unlocking unprecedented levels of democratization and innovation. Agent-to-agent protocols ease interactions and integrations Agent-to-agent protocols are redefining interactions between humans, agents, IT systems, and devices. Rather than relying on traditional IT system integrations such as middleware and APIs that require heavy programming and custom system-to-system connections, agent-to-agent protocols enable systems to use agents to communicate with other systems. By moving to agent- to-agent dialogue that sits above the underlying system complexity, organizations can integrate legacy systems, cloud platforms, and even machines such as drones into cohesive workflows more quickly and at lower cost. More important, this allows for faster experimentation\u2014in which new capabilities can be tested, scaled, or deprecated without months of engineering effort. Dynamic sourcing becomes critical Many business-critical platforms were historically built in-house or selected in rigorous sourcing processes, with multiyear implementation transformations. These systems were intended to remain largely stable to secure competitiveness for decades. A much more flexible strategy will be needed in the agentic age. Large language models and AI products are evolving so fast that locking in one solution or vendor can lead to technology that is outdated in a matter of weeks. At the same time, organizations will need to wall in proprietary organizational context, institutional knowledge, and nonpublic data for competitiveness. This requires architecture that separates the agentic structure, logic, and data from the underlying vendor landscape. 8 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era How to start the journey The most frequent question we heard in our discussions with executives was, \u201cHow do I start?\u201d Executives wonder how to create a North Star vision without clarity on what the future holds; how to assess maturity and upgrade needs for data, technical, and governance foundations; how to set priorities for value and feasibility; how to bring the organization along in terms of skills and mindset; and how to scale faster than rivals to create a competitive advantage. The clear and present danger is ending up with \u201cmore pilots than Lufthansa,\u201d being disconnected from value drivers, seeing AI everywhere but in your profit-and-loss statements, or ending up with PR fiascos. Building on our transformation experiences, we believe that companies that want to secure a competitive advantage in developing an agentic organization should think boldly , move fast , and go deep . In the journey to become an agentic AI leader, executives will need a different mindset to get to a coherent set of choices and actions across the 15 themes we have laid out in this article (Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3Web <2025> <AgenticAI3> Exhibit <3> of <3> Key transformations, by organizational pillarAgentic organizations will unlock changes across 15 core themes.

Don\u2019t let this happen. Leadership teams will need to take bold stances in adapting operating models toward the agentic organization\u2014replacing functional silos with cross-functional autonomous agentic teams, redesigning incentives and support processes to enable the change, and investing in required capabilities. \u2014From technology-forward to future-back: Delegating the agentic transformation to your technology leader, as you would with a software", "metadata": {"source": "C:\\Users\\USER\\github\\langchain-kr-main\\lifestyle\\Mckinsey\\the-agentic-organization-contours-of-the-next-paradigm-for-the-ai-era.pdf", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 5, "title": "the agentic organization contours of the next paradigm for the ai era"}}, {"id": "mckinsey-the-agentic-organization-contours-of-the-next-paradigm-for-the-ai-era-4", "content": "archetypes (AI orchestrators, deep specialists, and an AI-empowered front line) emergeSimpli/f_ied integration Agent-to-agent protocols ease integrations among agents, systems, and devices New sources of di\ufb00erentiation Proprietary data becomes a key di\ufb00erentiable factorFlat and /f_luid networks Dynamic, highly empowered teams steer to valueHuman oversight remains The sweet spot be- tween accountability and speed mattersCulture matters even more Leaders set context for scaling, build trust, and guide ethicallyDynamic sourcing Flexibility in decisions to buy or build avoids lock-in and protects intellectual property 9 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era We encourage leaders to think through three radical shifts to make a step change in how to transform for the agentic era: \u2014From linear to exponential: While technology develops exponentially, organizations and operating models typically evolve linearly, which can limit how much value an organization can ultimately capture.

Leadership teams will need to take bold stances in adapting operating models toward the agentic organization\u2014replacing functional silos with cross-functional autonomous agentic teams, redesigning incentives and support processes to enable the change, and investing in required capabilities. \u2014From technology-forward to future-back: Delegating the agentic transformation to your technology leader, as you would with a software deployment, will not suffice. Leaders need to envision the organization of the future, its full value potential with AI-first processes and a hybrid human\u2013agent organization\u2014and then work backward to identify the places to begin. You can only learn by doing, not by reading books or talking about it on the golf course. Bringing this to life by boldly reimagining one end-to-end domain will go a long way in building the organization\u2019s learning muscle. And in parallel, leaders should start planning for and building the scaling enablers beyond their first lighthouse. \u2014From threat to opportunity: Leaders may feel apprehension about agentic AI\u2019s impact on day-to-day operations. It is critical for executives to continuously engage with employees about the new possibilities that this technology can unlock, not just for the organization\u2019s growth and purpose, but also for them as professionals. Overinvesting in upskilling beyond basic literacy\u2014as well as change management, incentives, budget, communications, and performance management to support the transition\u2014will help pave the way. Concretely, leadership teams can start by taking these steps: making agentic AI a prominent part of the top team agenda; outlining the CEO\u2019s vision for creating an agentic organization; ramping up an AI center of excellence; upskilling people; and rewiring one or two lighthouse domains4 to launch agentic processes quickly and \u201clearn live.\u201d 4 Lighthouse domains are strategic areas or business functions that have the potential to produce substantial value with the assistance of AI, are visible to the rest of the organization, and have sufficient technological maturity.Companies that want to secure a competitive advantage in developing an agentic organization should think boldly , move fast , and go deep . 10 The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era Organizational paradigms do coexist: 89 percent of organizations still live in the industrial age, while 9 percent have agile or product and platform operating models from the digital age, and only 1 percent act as a decentralized network . But the time has come for organizations to move as quickly as possible toward the new agentic paradigm to gain a significant competitive advantage or risk being left behind. Many factors will influence the pace of adoption, including the development of AI models, availability of computing power, progress in robotics, changes in regulations, societal understanding and acceptance, and the human appetite for risk and change. While our insights will evolve along with AI technology in the months and years to come, we are certain that the organizations that adapt and learn faster will be the early winners in this agentic era.

But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value. This article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall and Tara Balakrishnan, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. Key findings 1. Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase: Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise. 2. High curiosity in AI agents: Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents. 3. Positive leading indicators on impact of AI: Respondents report use-case level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39 percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level. 4. High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost: Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives. 5. Redesigning workflows is a key success factor: Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows. 6. Differing perspectives on employment impact: Respondents vary in their expectations of AI\u2019s impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32 percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13 percent increases. 2 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Three years since the introduction of gen AI tools triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AI\u2014but the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise- level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider use\u2014including growing proliferation of agentic AI\u2014and stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations. 3 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.

Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say they\u2019re only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).

Already, about a quarter of our survey respondents report that they have started scaling at least one agentic AI system, but usually only in one or two business functions. Looking across the entire enterprise landscape, the use of agents is not yet widespread. This gap highlights the contrast between the great potential that manifests in a \u201chype cycle\u201d and the current reality on the ground: For those companies that respondents say have started to use agents in any particular business function, most of them are still in the exploratory stages. And as we recently documented in another article about the lessons we\u2019ve learned from a year of building agentic AI tools: When it comes to agents, it takes hard work to do it well. 7 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises. For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases The use of AI overall is broadening within organizations. Respondents increasingly report that their organizations are using AI in more business functions (Exhibit 4). More than two-thirds of respondents now say their organizations are using AI in more than one function, and half report using AI in three or more functions (for a breakdown by industry, see sidebar, \u201cReported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry\u201d). Exhibit 4 Business functions at respondents\u2019 organizations that are using AI,\u00b9 % of respondents 1In 2021, n = 1,843; in 2022, n = 1,492; in 2023, n = 1,684; in Feb\u2013Mar 2024, n = 1,363; in July 2024, n = 1,491; in June\u2013July 2025, n = 1,993.

In last year\u2019s research, respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of other industries with respect to their use of AI. Now, respondents in media and telecommunications and insurance are just as likely as those in technology to report AI use (exhibit). Throughout eight years of AI research, we have consistently seen IT and marketing and sales as the business functions that respondents most often say are using AI. But our latest findings show that knowledge management is now also one of the functions with the most reported AI use. Looking at individual use cases within business functions, respondents most often report using AI to capture information as well as processing and delivering it, such as through a conversational interface; in content support for marketing strategy, including drafting, generating ideas, and presenting knowledge for creating marketing strategies; and in contact-center or customer service automation. 8 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Sidebar (continued) Reported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry Exhibit Business functions in which respondents\u2019 organizations are regularly using AI, by industry,1 % of respondents 1Respondents who said \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cother\u201d are not shown.

AI as a catalyst for innovation Responses suggest that for most organizations, the use of AI has not yet significantly affected enterprise-wide EBIT. Thirty-nine percent of respondents attribute any level of EBIT impact to AI, and most of those respondents say that less than 5 percent of their organization\u2019s EBIT is attributable to AI use.

This year\u2019s data confirm that trajectory\u2014AI use is broadening, but scale still lags. We are seeing that while companies may have rolled out AI tools, most have not yet productized use cases, redesigned workflows around AI and agentic capabilities, or built the platforms/guardrails needed to run them at scale. In working with organizations, we find that the largest ones have the scale to invest in AI to advance more quickly. The companies reporting EBIT impact tend to have progressed further in their scaling journeys. All business leaders are seeking to make their companies more efficient, but the real results emerge when leaders are also able to use technology to innovate. Revenue increases resulting from AI use are most commonly reported in use cases within marketing and sales, strategy and corporate finance, and product and service development, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the years we have been conducting the survey (Exhibit 8).

Often, organizations approach AI through a cost-first mindset. While many see leading indicators from efficiency gains, focusing only on cost can limit AI\u2019s impact. Positioning AI as an enabler of growth and innovation creates space within the organization to go after the cost and efficiency improvements more effectively. And for many organizations, an efficiency play will not be sufficient to navigate AI disruption. They will need to consider how AI can be leveraged to tell a transformational story to their stakeholders. Doing so also supports change management internally. Employees tend to rally behind a shared vision of opportunity. In our experience, many of the organizations that use AI to inspire growth and innovation are the same ones that find it easier to scale AI use and ultimately realize sustainable productivity improvements. In addition to high aspirations at the enterprise level, high performers are also nearly three times as likely as others are to say their organizations have fundamentally redesigned individual workflows (Exhibit 11). Indeed, this intentional redesigning of workflows has one of the strongest contributions to achieving meaningful business impact of all the factors tested.1 1 To identify which organizational practices differentiate high performers, we conducted a relative weights analysis on 31 variables. This method estimates each variable\u2019s unique contribution to explaining high-performance status, accounting for correlations among predictors.Exhibit 11 1Question was asked only of respondents whose organizations use AI in at least 1 function. \u00b2AI high performers are respondents who reported that more than 5% of their organization\u2019s EBIT and \u201csigni/f_icant value\u201d are attributable to the organization\u2019s use of AI.

This year\u2019s survey suggests that leading organizations successfully implement a set of practices that bridge the interface between AI and human users. In fact, one of the leading practices is effectively determining how and when to incorporate \u201chuman in the loop,\u201d for example, in the development, testing, and deployment of AI solutions. This is consistent with our real-world experience with companies, too; AI is rarely a stand-alone solution. Instead, companies capture value when they effectively enable employees with real-world domain experience to interact with AI solutions at the right points. The combination of AI solutions alongside human judgment and expertise is what creates real \u201chybrid intelligence\u201d superpowers and real value capture. AI leaders adopt a set of other practices that point in this same direction, including fully embedding AI solutions into business workflows and having senior leaders actively engaged in driving adoption at scale. Interestingly, the ten leading management practices highlighted by this year\u2019s survey include all six elements of McKinsey\u2019s Rewired playbook for digital and AI transformations. While each year we test new practices, one evergreen principle holds true: Companies that effectively deliver across six primary elements (strategy, talent, operating model, technology, data, and adoption and scaling) are the ones reporting significant value creation from their AI investments. Expectations vary on AI\u2019s effect on workforce size As organizations expand their use of AI, respondents share differing perspectives on how AI might affect their workforce size in the year ahead. Looking at the functions in which organizations are using AI, a plurality of respondents observed little to no change in the number of employees due to their organization\u2019s use of AI in the past year. In most functions, fewer than 20 percent of respondents report decreases of 3 percent or more, and smaller shares say their organization\u2019s AI use led them to add head count within functions. However, larger shares of respondents expect changes in the number of employees in these functions in the year ahead (Exhibit 16). Across business functions, a median of 17 percent of respondents report declines in functions\u2019 workforce size in the past year as a result of AI use, but a median of 30 percent expect a decrease in the next year. 22 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Exhibit 16 Change in number of employees over the past year due to AI in the given business functions, \u00b9 % of respondents 1Question was asked only of respondents who said their organization regularly uses AI in the given business function.

Still, even in these early days of adoption, we are seeing changes in the skills demanded for a range of jobs. Across positions like claims adjusters, digital marketers, and wealth managers, we are seeing increasing demand for AI skills; typically, this is about incorporating AI into existing roles or workflows. In terms of how AI will affect head count, about a third of respondents say they expect their organization\u2019s workforce to decline in size\u2014though interestingly, a small percentage of respondents say they expect their organization\u2019s head count to increase, and some report head count increases over the past year across functions as diverse as IT, supply chain, and sales. Some of these jobs will become more critical as AI adoption increases. AI success, for example, requires data readiness and MLOps. We see larger companies in particular hiring for those skills; they are twice as likely to hire roles that integrate, model, and industrialize data. Efforts to mitigate AI risks are becoming more common as challenges materialize Over the past six years, our research has consistently found that few risks associated with the use of AI are mitigated by most respondents\u2019 organizations. In our latest findings, the share of respondents reporting mitigation efforts for risks such as personal and individual privacy, explainability, organizational reputation, and regulatory compliance has grown since we last asked about risks associated with AI overall in 2022. (In 2023 and 2024, we asked specifically about gen AI\u2013related risks.) Back in 2022, respondents reported acting to manage an average of two AI-related risks, compared with four risks today. We also see that, largely, the risks that organizations are experiencing and are working to mitigate are connected: Respondents are more likely to say their organizations are mitigating each of the risks they have experienced consequences from. Overall, 51 percent of respondents from organizations using AI say their organizations have seen at least one instance of a negative consequence, with nearly one-third of all respondents reporting consequences stemming from AI inaccuracy (Exhibit 19). Inaccuracy is one of two risks that most respondents say their organizations are working to mitigate. However, the second-most-commonly-reported risk\u2014 explainability\u2014is not among the most commonly mitigated. 26 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Respondents from AI high performers, who say their organizations have deployed twice as many AI use cases as others have, are more likely than others to report negative consequences\u2014 particularly related to intellectual property infringement and regulatory compliance. High performers also try to protect against a larger number of risks. Exhibit 19 1Questions were asked only of respondents whose organizations regularly use Al in at least 1 function.

Most organizations are still navigating the transition from experimentation to scaled deployment, and while they may be capturing value in some parts of the organization, they\u2019re not yet realizing enterprise-wide financial impact. The experience of the highest-performing companies suggests a path forward. These organizations stand out for thinking beyond incremental efficiency gains: They treat AI as a catalyst to transform their organizations, redesigning workflows and accelerating innovation. As AI tools, including agents, improve and companies\u2019 capabilities mature, the opportunity to embed AI more fully into the enterprise will offer organizations new ways to capture value and create competitive advantage. 28 The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation Alex Singla is the global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s Chicago office; Alexander Sukharevsky is a senior partner in the London office; Lareina Yee is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui is a senior fellow; Bryce Hall is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office; and Tara Balakrishnan is an associate partner in the Seattle office.

Wellness is about more than feeling good. It\u2019s a thriving business that is poised to keep growing. Health is wealth , for all of us\u2014and increasingly, for organizations that operate in the wellness space. The business of health is thriving. According to McKinsey\u2019s latest Future of Wellness research, which surveyed more than 5,000 consumers in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the global consumer wellness market has reached $1.8 trillion per year . In the United States, the wellness market is growing as much as 10 percent per year and is now worth $480 billion. Eighty-two percent of US consumers now consider wellness a top or important priority in their everyday lives\u2014 similar to the 87 percent and 73 percent who say so in China and the United Kingdom, respectively. \u201cWe knew that consumers were increasingly treating wellness as a priority,\u201d says McKinsey partner Anna Pione . \u201cWhat surprised us and continues to surprise us every year is how much of a priority it is .\u201d Most of us realize intuitively that health is much more than the presence or absence of disease. But what do we mean when we talk about wellness? McKinsey defines wellness along six dimensions: better health, fitness, sleep, mindfulness, appearance, and nutrition. In this Explainer , we\u2019ll delve into what people care about when it comes to their health and the changes we can expect in this space in the future. Learn more about the McKinsey Health Institute . What are the top trends shaping the consumer health and wellness space? In a world where people are prioritizing health more than they used to, consumers are increasingly focused\u2014and spending\u2014on products and services that are supported by data and science. Their emerging priorities can be grouped into five trends : \u2014Health at home. The COVID-19 pandemic made at-home testing kits a household item. Now that the pandemic is less front of mind, many consumers are showing interest in other at-home kits, for everything from vitamin and mineral deficiencies to cholesterol levels. This is an emerging trend throughout the countries surveyed. In China, for instance, 35 percent of consumers reported that they had replaced some in-person healthcare appointments with at-home diagnostic tests. \u2014Biomonitoring and wearables. About half of all surveyed consumers have purchased a fitness wearable at some point. Watches are the most common fitness tracker, but other types of technology are becoming more popular. These include wearable biometric rings paired with mobile apps and continuous glucose monitors, which can be applied to the back of a user\u2019s arm to track their blood sugar levels. More than three-quarters of respondents said they would be open to using a wearable device in the future. \u2014Personalization\u2019s gen AI boost. People like personalization: nearly one in five US consumers and one in three US millennials prefer personalized products and services. Some are even willing to part with their biometric data in exchange for personalized recommendations. There\u2019s an opportunity here to pair these tools with generative AI (gen AI) to enable more precise personalization: for example, designing customized workouts for users based on their fitness data, which some wearables are already using gen AI to do. \u2014Clinical over \u201cclean.\u201d Users are beginning to move away from wellness products that tout \u201cclean\u201d or natural ingredients and toward those with clinically proven ingredients. Roughly half of UK and US consumers reported clinical effectiveness as a top purchasing factor; only 20 percent said the same for clean ingredients. In the United States, this trend is most pronounced in over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements, and beauty products. \u2014The rise of the doctor recommendation. As the influencer economy grows\u2014and with it, potentially dubious or compromised health opinions\u2014consumers value recommendations from doctors more than ever. Consumers say that doctors\u2019 recommendations matter most when they\u2019re seeking care related to mindfulness, sleep, and overall health (including the use of vitamins and over-the-counter medications). 2 What is the future of wellness? What are the biggest areas of growth in the wellness industry? McKinsey\u2019s Future of Wellness research, begun in 2020, indicates noteworthy growth in several key areas : \u2014Women\u2019s health. In the past, women seeking healthcare have been underserved . Women\u2019s health products are more available today than ever before\u2014and purchases are up, too. The largest shares of respondents said they purchased menstrual-care and sexual-health products in the past year, yet consumers said they spent the most on menopause and pregnancy-related products. But there are still unmet needs in this space , particularly related to menopause. \u2014Healthy aging. A move toward preventative medicine, the growth of health technology, and advances in research on antiaging products are propelling demand for products and services that support healthy aging and longevity . Around 70 percent of consumers in the United Kingdom and United States and 85 percent in China said they purchased more in the healthy- aging category in the past year than in prior years. The results were similar across age groups. \u2014Weight management. Nearly one in three US adults has a body mass index of 30 or higher, which is the threshold for obesity. And 60 percent of US respondents to our survey said they are currently trying to lose weight. G lucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs, including O zempic and Wegovy, are rapidly growing in popularity. This is especially true in the United S tates, where more than 50 percent of A merican c onsumers c onsider p rescription medication to be a \u201cvery effective\u201d weight m anagement i ntervention. \u2014In-person fitness. Fitness is moving from a hobby to a core part of people\u2019s identities, es pecially among Gen Z consumers. Fifty-six percent of US Gen Zers surveyed considered fitness a \u201cvery high priority,\u201d compared with 40 percent of US consumers overall. Based on Mc Kinsey analysis, we expect consumers to ma intain their spending on fitness club me mberships and fitness apps and increase th eir spending on in-person fitness classes and personal t raining. \u2014Gut health. More than 80 percent of consumers in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States consider gut health to be important\u2014 and more than half of respondents said it will be a higher priority over the next two to three years. People in China and the United States are more likely to take probiotic supplements, whereas UK consumers typically choose foods with probiotics, including kimchi, kombucha, or yogurt. \u2014Sexual health. We\u2019ve seen growing demand for sexual-health products, likely due to expanded conversations around sexuality, improvements in sexual education, and growing support for female sexual-health challenges. Eighty-seven percent of US consumers report having spent the same or more on sexual-health products (such as contraceptives and adult toys) in the past year than the year prior. \u2014Sleep. Sleep is the second-highest health and wellness priority for consumers\u2014and also where consumers say they have the most unmet needs. A large number of factors can affect a good night\u2019s sleep, including diet, exercise, caffeine, screen time, and stress. Few, if any, tech players have been able to develop a holistic solution to consumers\u2019 sleep issues\u2014though sleep tech is a fast-growing industry .

Of course, there\u2019s as much diversity and variance in lifestyles and preferences among older adults as there is among younger people. But a 2023 McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) survey of more than 21,000 people aged 55 and older across 21 countries found that there were some commonalities . Respondents typically agreed with the importance of having purpose, managing stress, enjoying meaningful connections with others, and preserving their independence. Many of these factors intersect with a subject\u2019s real and perceived health across four dimensions: mental, physical, social, and spiritual. Overall, survey respondents\u2019 perceived health in every dimension\u2014and in physical health most of all\u2014 declines as they age. Mental health is the most positively rated dimension for those aged 55 to 64; for people aged 65 and older, spiritual health is the most positively rated dimension. Money also matters to older adults\u2019 well-being. Across countries, older adults who are financially stable are more likely than their counterparts to be able to adhere to healthy habits, including those that boost cognitive health. Notably, though, respondents in high-income economies aren\u2019t necessarily thriving more than their peers in economies where incomes aren\u2019t as high. For example, nearly 20 percent of respondents in high- income economies say they would like to work in their old age but aren\u2019t currently doing so. Older adults in high-income economies also report much lower levels of societal participation than their counterparts in other economies. Another key finding is that participation pays off. Survey respondents who work, volunteer, attend classes, or otherwise engage in their communities report better overall health than those who don\u2019t. McKinsey\u2019s analysis also indicates that older adults who engage in their communities have lower healthcare costs.Learn more about the McKinsey Health Institute , and click here to learn about health-related job opportunities if you\u2019re interested in working at McKinsey.
